## _function AddInput(inp)
**AddInput**: The function of AddInput is to process the input provided by the user and perform various operations based on the input.

**parameters**:
- inp: The input string provided by the user.
- PrintAnswer: A boolean flag indicating whether to print the answer.
- Print: A boolean flag indicating whether to print the input sentence.
- PrintInputSentenceOverride: A boolean flag indicating whether to override the default behavior of printing the input sentence.
- PrintInputSentenceOverrideValue: A boolean value specifying the override value for printing the input sentence.

**Code Description**:
The AddInput function takes in an input string provided by the user and performs several operations based on the input. 

First, it checks if the input string does not end with a question mark, does not start with an asterisk, and the UseLastQuestionInContext flag is set to True. If these conditions are met, it appends the last question asked to the input string.

Next, it calls the NAR.AddInput function with the input string and several optional parameters. The PrintAnswer, Print, PrintInputSentenceOverride, and PrintInputSentenceOverrideValue parameters control the printing behavior during the execution of the NAR.AddInput function.

If the input string ends with a question mark, it prints the GPT_Answer from the return value of the NAR.AddInput function.

The function also handles various special cases based on the input string. If the input string starts with "//", it returns an empty dictionary. If the input string starts with "*volume=", it returns an empty dictionary. If the input string starts with "*prompt", it generates and prints a prompt based on the current time, memory, and relevant view size. If the input string starts with "<" or "(", or contains " :|:", it performs additional operations related to Narsese encoding. If the QuestionPriming flag is set to True and the input string ends with a question mark, it queries the NAR system with the input string. If the AutoGroundNarsese flag is set to True, it performs grounding on the input string. It then processes the input string using the ProcessInput function and updates the current time.

If the input string starts with "*memory", it prints the contents of the memory. If the input string starts with "*ground=", it extracts the Narsese string from the input string and performs grounding on it. If the input string starts with "*time", it prints the current time. If the input string starts with "*reset", it resets the memory, atoms, current time, and calls the NAR.AddInput function with "*reset". If the input string starts with "*buffer", it generates and prints a memory view based on the current time, memory, and relevant view size. If the input string starts with "*concurrent", it calls the NAR.AddInput function with the input string and decrements the current time. If the input string starts with "*", it calls the NAR.AddInput function with the input string.

If none of the special cases are met, the input string is converted to lowercase. If the input string ends with a question mark, it generates a prompt based on the current time, memory, relevant view size, and the input string. It then calls the PromptProcess function with the generated prompt and input string, and updates the current time. If the input string does not end with a question mark, it calls the ProcessInput function with the input string and updates the current time.

Finally, it eternalizes the memory based on the current time and eternalization distance, and stores the memory and atoms in a file.

**Note**:
- The AddInput function performs various operations based on the input string provided by the user.
- The function handles special cases such as printing the memory, performing grounding, resetting the system, and generating prompts.
- The function calls the NAR.AddInput function to process the input string and obtain the result.
- The function updates the current time and stores the memory and atoms in a file.
## _function RaiseQuestion
**RaiseQuestion**: The function of RaiseQuestion is to prompt the user to raise a question about a specific topic that is not addressed by any existing memory item. It then processes the user's input and performs necessary modifications to the answer before printing it and storing it as the last question.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `RaiseQuestion` function begins by declaring the `lastquestion` variable as a global variable. This variable will store the last question asked by the user.

Next, the function calls the `NAR.AddInput` function to prompt the user to raise a question. The prompt includes the topic specified by the `LearnMoreAbout` variable. The function sets the `PrintAnswer`, `Print`, `PrintInputSentenceOverride`, and `PrintInputSentenceOverrideValue` parameters to control the printing behavior during the prompt.

The function then retrieves the answer from the returned dictionary and performs some modifications. It splits the answer at the question mark symbol (`?`) and adds it back to the answer, ensuring that the question mark is preserved. This modification is done to ensure that the printed answer ends with a question mark.

The modified answer is then printed to the console.

Next, the function calls the `NAR.I_You_Exchange` function to perform a pronoun exchange in the answer. This function replaces pronouns such as "you" and "your" with their corresponding pronouns "I" and "my" to change the perspective from the user to the AI assistant.

Finally, the function updates the `lastquestion` variable with the modified answer.

**Note**: It is important to note that the `RaiseQuestion` function relies on the `NAR.AddInput` and `NAR.I_You_Exchange` functions to prompt the user and perform the pronoun exchange, respectively. The `lastquestion` variable is used to store the last question asked by the user.
