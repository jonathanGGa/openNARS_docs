## _function Truth_Expectation(v)
**Truth_Expectation**: The function of Truth_Expectation is to calculate the truth expectation value based on a given input.

**parameters**:
- v: A tuple representing the input values for the calculation. It should contain two elements, where the first element is a float representing a value, and the second element is a float representing a coefficient.

**Code Description**:
The Truth_Expectation function takes a tuple as input and performs a mathematical calculation to determine the truth expectation value. The calculation is done by multiplying the second element of the input tuple (v[1]) with the difference between the first element of the input tuple (v[0]) and 0.5, and then adding 0.5 to the result. The final result is returned as the output of the function.

This function is called in the code of two objects in the project: "Memory.py/RetrieveQuestionRelatedBeliefs" and "Memory.py/query".

In the "Memory.py/RetrieveQuestionRelatedBeliefs" object, the Truth_Expectation function is used as part of a sorting mechanism. The code sorts a list of items based on two criteria: the match quality of a query and the truth expectation value calculated using the Truth_Expectation function. The items are represented as tuples, where the second element of each tuple is passed as an argument to the Truth_Expectation function. The sorting is done in descending order, with the highest match quality and truth expectation values appearing first.

In the "Memory.py/query" object, the Truth_Expectation function is used to compare truth expectation values of different terms. The code splits a given term into two parts and searches for matching terms in the memory. For each matching term, the truth expectation value is calculated using the Truth_Expectation function. The code then selects the term with the highest truth expectation value as the best term. This comparison is done to determine the most relevant term based on its truth expectation value.

**Note**: 
- The Truth_Expectation function expects the input tuple to have two elements, otherwise it may result in an error.
- The output of the Truth_Expectation function is a float value representing the calculated truth expectation.

**Output Example**: 
If the input tuple is (0.6, 0.8), the Truth_Expectation function will return the value 0.68.
## _function Truth_Projection(v, originalTime, targetTime)
**Truth_Projection**: The function of Truth_Projection is to calculate the truth value of a proposition at a target time based on its original truth value and the time difference between the original time and the target time.

**parameters**:
- v: A tuple representing the original truth value of the proposition, where v[0] is the truth value and v[1] is the confidence level.
- originalTime: The original time at which the truth value is measured.
- targetTime: The target time at which the truth value needs to be projected.

**Code Description**:
The Truth_Projection function takes in three parameters: v, originalTime, and targetTime. It calculates the projected truth value of a proposition at the target time based on its original truth value and the time difference between the original time and the target time.

The function first extracts the truth value and confidence level from the input tuple v. It then calculates the time difference between the original time and the target time using the abs() function. The formula used to calculate the projected truth value is v[1] * (0.8 ** abs(targetTime - originalTime)), where v[1] represents the confidence level.

The function returns a tuple with two elements: the original truth value v[0] and the projected truth value v[1] * (0.8 ** abs(targetTime - originalTime)).

This function is called within the Memory_generate_prompt function in the Memory.py file. In the Memory_generate_prompt function, the Truth_Projection function is used to calculate the projected truth value of a proposition based on the current time, memory, prompt start and end, relevant view size, recent view size, and input question. The calculated truth value is then used to construct a prompt memory string.

**Note**: 
- The Truth_Projection function assumes that the input tuple v has a length of 2, where v[0] represents the truth value and v[1] represents the confidence level.
- The time difference between the original time and the target time is calculated using the abs() function to ensure a positive value.
- The formula used to calculate the projected truth value uses a decay factor of 0.8 raised to the power of the absolute time difference. This decay factor decreases the confidence level of the truth value as the time difference increases.
- The Memory_generate_prompt function utilizes the Truth_Projection function to calculate the projected truth value of propositions in the memory and construct a prompt memory string.
- The prompt memory string includes information about the proposition, such as its term, time, and confidence level, as well as the index of the proposition in the memory.
- If the confidence level of the truth value is less than 0.5, the term is modified to include the phrase "not" before the main term.
- The prompt memory string is constructed by concatenating the information of each proposition in the memory.
- If the memory is empty, the prompt memory string will be set to "EMPTY!".

**Output Example**:
If the input tuple v is (0.6, 0.9), the originalTime is 10, and the targetTime is 15, the function will return (0.6, 0.59049).
