## _function toNarsese(subject_relation_predicate)
**toNarsese**: The function of toNarsese is to convert a given subject-relation-predicate tuple into a Narsese statement.

**parameters**:
- subject_relation_predicate: A tuple containing the subject, relation, and predicate.

**Code Description**:
The `toNarsese` function takes a subject-relation-predicate tuple as input and converts it into a Narsese statement. It first unpacks the tuple into separate variables for subject, relation, and predicate. 

The function then checks the value of the `relation` parameter. If the relation is "IsA", it further checks if the first character of the subject is uppercase. If it is uppercase, it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<{subject} --> predicate>.". Otherwise, it returns "<subject --> predicate>.".

If the relation is "InstanceOf", it checks if the first character of the subject is lowercase. If it is lowercase, it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<subject --> predicate>.". Otherwise, it returns "<{subject} --> predicate>.".

If the relation is "HasProperty", it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<subject --> [predicate]>.".

If the relation is "DistinctFrom", it returns a Narsese statement in the form "(--,<subject <-> predicate>).".

If the relation is "SimilarTo", it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<subject <-> predicate>.".

If the relation is "Causes", it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<subject =/> predicate>.".

If none of the above conditions are met, it returns a Narsese statement in the form "<(subject * predicate) --> relation.replace("PartOf", "part_of").replace("HasA", "have").replace("MadeOf", "make_of").replace("Desires", "want").lower()>.".

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the subject, relation, and predicate are strings.
- The function does not perform any input validation or error handling.

**Output Example**:
- Input: ("Cat", "IsA", "Animal")
- Output: "<Cat --> Animal>."
## _function unwrap(rel)
**unwrap**: The function of unwrap is to extract specific parts from a given string.

**parameters**:
- rel: A string representing a relationship.

**Code Description**:
The `unwrap` function takes a relationship string as input and extracts specific parts from it. The relationship string is expected to be in a specific format, where the parts are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. The function first uses the `split` method to remove the square brackets from the string. Then, it uses the `replace` method to remove specific substrings ("/c/en/", "/n/", "/r/", and "/") from the string. Finally, it uses the `split` method again to split the string into individual parts based on the comma separator.

The function returns a tuple containing the extracted parts in a specific order: the second part, the first part, and the third part.

This function is called by the `queryConceptNet` function in the `concept_net_narsese.py` module. In the `queryConceptNet` function, the `unwrap` function is used to extract the parts of the relationship string returned by the ConceptNet API. These parts are then used to check if the relationship involves the specified term and to determine the count of the term in the relationship. The extracted parts are also converted to Narsese format using the `toNarsese` function.

**Note**:
- The `unwrap` function assumes that the relationship string is in the expected format. If the format is different, the function may raise an exception or return unexpected results.
- The function does not perform any validation or error handling for the extracted parts. It is assumed that the parts will always be present and in the expected order.
- The function does not handle any special characters or encoding in the relationship string.

**Output Example**:
If the input relationship string is "[/c/en/dog]/r/IsA[/c/en/animal]", the function will return ("IsA", "dog", "animal").
## _function queryConceptNet(maxAmount, term, side, relation)
**queryConceptNet**: The function of queryConceptNet is to query the ConceptNet API for relationships between a given term and other concepts based on a specified relation.

**parameters**:
- maxAmount: An integer representing the maximum number of results to retrieve from the ConceptNet API.
- term: A string representing the term to query.
- side: A string representing the side of the relationship to query. It can be either "end" or "start".
- relation: A string representing the relation to query.

**Code Description**:
The `queryConceptNet` function queries the ConceptNet API to retrieve relationships between a given term and other concepts based on a specified relation. It first constructs the API request URL by concatenating the `side`, `/c/en/` + `term`, `/r/` + `relation`, and `limit` parameters. The `limit` parameter is set to the value of `maxAmount`.

The function then sends a GET request to the constructed URL using the `requests.get` method from the `requests` library. It retrieves the response in JSON format and extracts the `edges` from the response.

Next, the function iterates over each `edge` in the `edges` list. For each `edge`, it calls the `unwrap` function to extract the subject, value, and predicate from the `@id` field of the `edge`. It checks if either the subject or the predicate is equal to the given `term` and if neither the subject nor the predicate contain an underscore character. If these conditions are met, it retrieves the count of the predicate from the `wordcounts` dictionary based on whether the subject is equal to the given `term`. It then appends a tuple containing the Narsese representation of the subject, value, and predicate (obtained by calling the `toNarsese` function) and the count to the `ret` list.

Finally, the function returns the `ret` list, which contains the Narsese representations of the relationships between the given term and other concepts based on the specified relation.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `term`, `side`, and `relation` parameters are strings, and the `maxAmount` parameter is an integer.
- The function relies on the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and retrieve responses from the ConceptNet API.
- The function depends on the `unwrap` and `toNarsese` functions to extract specific parts from the API response and convert relationships to Narsese format, respectively.
- The function does not perform any input validation or error handling.

**Output Example**:
- Input: `queryConceptNet(5, "Cat", "end", "IsA")`
- Output: `[("<Cat --> Animal>.", 10), ("<Cat --> Mammal>.", 5), ("<Cat --> Pet>.", 3), ("<Cat --> Feline>.", 2), ("<Cat --> DomesticAnimal>.", 1)]`
## _function queryMeaning(term, maxAmount, selectAmount, isEvent, querySpecificQuestion, question)
**queryMeaning**: The function of queryMeaning is to query the ConceptNet API for the meaning of a given term based on a specified set of criteria.

**parameters**:
- term: A string representing the term to query.
- maxAmount: An integer representing the maximum number of results to retrieve from the ConceptNet API.
- selectAmount: An integer representing the number of results to select from the retrieved results.
- isEvent: A boolean value indicating whether the term represents an event.
- querySpecificQuestion: A boolean value indicating whether the query is specific to a question.
- question: A string representing the question to query.

**Code Description**:
The `queryMeaning` function is responsible for querying the ConceptNet API to retrieve the meaning of a given term based on a set of specified criteria. It first initializes an empty list called `ret` to store the results. 

The function then defines a list called `Relations` which contains a set of predefined relations. These relations represent different types of relationships that can exist between concepts in ConceptNet. 

Next, the function checks the value of the `querySpecificQuestion` parameter. If it is `True`, the function further checks the `question` parameter to determine the specific relation to query. If certain patterns are found in the `question` parameter, the `Relations` list is updated accordingly.

After determining the relations to query, the function iterates over each relation in the `Relations` list. For each relation, it further iterates over each side in the `["end", "start"]` list. This allows the function to query both the extension and intension of the given term. 

Inside the nested loops, the function calls the `queryConceptNet` function (defined in a separate object) to retrieve the relationships between the given term and other concepts based on the current relation and side. The results are then appended to the `ret` list.

Once all the queries have been performed, the `ret` list is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple. This ensures that the results with higher counts are placed at the beginning of the list.

If the `querySpecificQuestion` parameter is `False`, the function selects the first `selectAmount` results from the `ret` list. Otherwise, it includes all the results in the `ret` list.

The function then initializes variables `selected` and `returnlist` to keep track of the selected results and the final list of results, respectively. It iterates over each tuple in the `ret` list and checks if the Narsese representation of the tuple matches the specified question. If the question is not specific or the Narsese representation matches the question, the tuple is added to the `returnlist` along with a delimiter indicating whether the term represents an event.

Finally, the function returns the `returnlist`, which contains the Narsese representations of the relationships between the given term and other concepts based on the specified criteria.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `term` and `question` parameters are strings, the `maxAmount` and `selectAmount` parameters are integers, and the `isEvent` and `querySpecificQuestion` parameters are boolean values.
- The function relies on the `queryConceptNet` function to retrieve the relationships between the given term and other concepts.
- The function does not perform any input validation or error handling.

**Output Example**:
- Input: `queryMeaning("Cat", 5, 3, False, False, "")`
- Output: `["<Cat --> Animal>.", "<Cat --> Mammal>.", "<Cat --> Pet>."]`
## _function extractAtomicTerms(inp)
**extractAtomicTerms**: The function of extractAtomicTerms is to extract atomic terms from a given input string.

**parameters**:
- inp: The input string from which atomic terms need to be extracted.

**Code Description**:
The extractAtomicTerms function takes an input string and iterates through each character of the string. It checks if the character is a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) or a digit. If the character satisfies this condition, it is appended to the atomicTerm string. This process continues until a non-alphanumeric character is encountered. At that point, if the atomicTerm string is not empty, it is added to the list L, and the atomicTerm string is reset to an empty string. Finally, the function returns the list L containing all the extracted atomic terms.

**Note**:
- The function considers both uppercase and lowercase letters as valid characters for atomic terms.
- The function treats digits as valid characters for atomic terms.
- The function does not consider any special characters or whitespace as part of an atomic term.
- The function does not modify the original input string.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "Hello123 World", the function will return the list ['Hello123', 'World'].
