## _function ctests(branch, example, steps, seed, successCriteria)
**ctests**: The function of ctests is to run tests for the OpenNARS-for-Applications project.

**parameters**:
- branch: A string representing the branch of the project.
- example: A string representing the example to be tested.
- steps: An integer representing the number of steps to run the test.
- seed: An integer representing the seed value for randomization.
- successCriteria: A string representing the success criteria for the test.

**Code Description**:
The ctests function is responsible for running tests for the OpenNARS-for-Applications project. It takes in several parameters including the branch of the project, the example to be tested, the number of steps to run the test, the seed value for randomization, and the success criteria for the test.

First, the function constructs the folder path based on the provided branch. It then prints a command to build the project with the specified seed value. The os.system function is used to change the current directory to the project folder and execute the build command.

Next, the function sets the base path to the current working directory and changes the directory to the project folder. Another build command is executed to ensure the project is built with the specified seed value. The base path is then restored to the original working directory.

The function constructs the command to run the test by concatenating the project path, the example, and the number of steps. It also generates a filename based on the example, branch, and seed value.

The run function is called with the constructed command as the argument. The stdout and stderr outputs are captured and stored in the result variable. If the return code of the result is not 0, indicating an error, the function prints the stdout and stderr outputs and exits with the return code.

If the test is successful, the function opens the file with the generated filename in write mode. It iterates over the reversed lines of the stdout output and writes the line to the file if it contains the specified success criteria. Finally, the function prints a success message indicating the example was successful.

**Note**:
- The ctests function assumes that the project has already been built and the necessary dependencies are installed.
- The success criteria should be a unique identifier present in the output of the test.

**Output Example**:
```
Test output:
Success criteria met: example1=passed
example1 successful!
```
## _function pytests(branch, example, steps, seed, successCriteria)
**pytests**: The function of pytests is to run a test on a specific branch of the OpenNARS-for-Applications project. It executes a command to build the project with a given seed, and then runs a Python script with specified arguments. The output of the script is captured and saved to a file, and the function checks if the output meets a specified success criteria.

**parameters**:
- branch: A string representing the name of the branch to test.
- example: A string representing the name of the Python script to run.
- steps: An integer specifying the number of steps to run the script.
- seed: An integer representing the seed value for the build and test.
- successCriteria: A string specifying the success criteria to check in the output.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by constructing a folder path based on the provided branch name. It then prints a command to build the project with the given seed value. The function changes the current working directory to the project folder and executes the build command using the `os.system` function.

Next, the function changes the current working directory to the "misc/Python" folder within the project. It constructs a command string to run the specified Python script with the given number of steps. The function also creates a filename based on the example name, branch name, and seed value.

The function uses the `run` function from the `subprocess` module to execute the command and capture the output. If the return code of the command is not 0 (indicating an error), the function prints the standard output and standard error, and exits with the return code.

The function then changes the current working directory back to the original base path. It opens the file with the constructed filename in write mode and iterates over the reversed lines of the captured output. If a line contains the specified success criteria, it prints the line and writes it to the file.

Finally, the function prints a success message indicating that the example was successful.

**Note**: 
- The function assumes that the build.sh script and the Python script are located in specific directories within the project structure.
- The function relies on the availability of the `os` and `subprocess` modules.
- The success criteria should be a unique string that can be found in the output.

**Output Example**:
```
Result: success=true
Example successful!
```
