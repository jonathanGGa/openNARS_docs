## _function detectionPosition(x, y, w, h)
**detectionPosition**: The function of detectionPosition is to calculate the midpoint coordinates of a bounding box based on its top-left corner coordinates and width and height.

**Parameters**:
- x: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
- y: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box.
- w: The width of the bounding box.
- h: The height of the bounding box.

**Code Description**:
The detectionPosition function takes in the coordinates (x, y) of the top-left corner of a bounding box, as well as its width (w) and height (h). It then calculates the midpoint coordinates (xmid, ymid) of the bounding box by adding half of the width to the x-coordinate and half of the height to the y-coordinate. The function assumes that the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the image.

This function is called by the detectionToNarseseStatementsList function in the ona_darknet.py file. In the detectionToNarseseStatementsList function, the detectionPosition function is used to calculate the midpoint coordinates of a bounding box obtained from a detection. The resulting midpoint coordinates are then used in further calculations to determine the relative position of the bounding box within a fovea.

**Note**:
- The detectionPosition function assumes that the origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the image. If the coordinate system used in the project is different, the function should be adjusted accordingly.
- The detectionPosition function does not perform any validation or error handling for the input parameters. It is assumed that the input parameters are valid and appropriate for the task at hand.

**Output Example**:
If the input parameters are x = 10, y = 20, w = 30, and h = 40, the detectionPosition function will return the midpoint coordinates (xmid, ymid) as (25, 40).
## _function discretizedPosition(xmid, ymid)
**discretizedPosition**: The function of discretizedPosition is to calculate the discretized position of a given point.

**parameters**:
- xmid: The x-coordinate of the midpoint.
- ymid: The y-coordinate of the midpoint.

**Code Description**:
The discretizedPosition function takes in the coordinates of a midpoint (xmid, ymid) and calculates the discretized position of a point. It does this by dividing the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the midpoint by a discretization factor. The discretization factor is not provided in the code snippet and should be defined elsewhere in the code.

The function returns a tuple containing the discretized x-coordinate and discretized y-coordinate of the given point.

This function is called by the foveaRelativePosition function in the same module. The foveaRelativePosition function uses the discretizedPosition function to calculate the discretized position of a given point (x, y). It then compares the discretized position with the discretized midpoint position (xmid_discrete, ymid_discrete) to determine the relative position of the point with respect to the midpoint. The relative position is assigned labels based on the comparisons made.

**Note**:
- The discretization factor used in the discretizedPosition function should be defined elsewhere in the code.
- The discretizedPosition function assumes that the discretization factor is non-zero to avoid division by zero errors.

**Output Example**:
If the discretization factor is 10 and the midpoint coordinates are (20, 30), calling the discretizedPosition function with the point coordinates (25, 35) would return the tuple (2, 3), representing the discretized position of the point.
## _function discretizedSize(w, h)
**discretizedSize**: The function of discretizedSize is to determine the size category of an object based on its width and height.

**parameters**:
- w: The width of the object.
- h: The height of the object.

**Code Description**:
The discretizedSize function takes in the width and height of an object and calculates the maximum size between the two. It then compares the maximum size with predefined thresholds to determine the size category of the object. If the maximum size is less than 100, the function returns "small". If the maximum size is between 100 and 500, the function returns "average". Otherwise, if the maximum size is greater than or equal to 500, the function returns "large".

This function is used to categorize objects based on their size. By discretizing the size into three categories, it provides a simplified representation of the object's dimensions. This can be useful in various applications, such as object recognition or classification.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the width and height parameters are positive integers.
- If the width and height are equal, the function will consider that value as the maximum size.

**Output Example**:
- Example 1:
  - Input: w = 80, h = 120
  - Output: "small"
- Example 2:
  - Input: w = 200, h = 300
  - Output: "average"
- Example 3:
  - Input: w = 600, h = 400
  - Output: "large"
## _function foveaRelativePosition(x, y)
**foveaRelativePosition**: The function of foveaRelativePosition is to determine the relative position of a given point with respect to a midpoint in a discretized manner.

**parameters**:
- x: The x-coordinate of the point.
- y: The y-coordinate of the point.

**Code Description**:
The foveaRelativePosition function takes in the coordinates of a point (x, y) and calculates its relative position with respect to a midpoint. It first calls the discretizedPosition function to obtain the discretized position of the point. Then, it compares the discretized position with the discretized midpoint position to determine the relative position. The relative position is assigned labels based on the comparisons made.

The function returns a tuple containing the labels for the relative position of the point in the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.

**Note**:
- The discretizedPosition function, which is called by foveaRelativePosition, assumes that the discretization factor is non-zero to avoid division by zero errors. The discretization factor should be defined elsewhere in the code.
- The labels assigned to the relative position are "centeredX" and "centeredY" by default. If the point is to the left or right of the midpoint, the label for the x-axis will be "lessX" or "moreX", respectively. If the point is above or below the midpoint, the label for the y-axis will be "lessY" or "moreY", respectively.

**Output Example**:
If the point coordinates are (25, 35) and the discretized midpoint coordinates are (20, 30), calling the foveaRelativePosition function would return the tuple ("moreX", "moreY"), indicating that the point is to the right and below the midpoint.
## _function object_narsese(Property, Class, xLabel, yLabel, Confidence)
**object_narsese**: The function of object_narsese is to generate a Narsese statement based on the given parameters.

**parameters**:
- Property: A string representing the property of the object.
- Class: A string representing the class of the object.
- xLabel: A string representing the x-label of the object.
- yLabel: A string representing the y-label of the object.
- Confidence (optional): A float representing the confidence level of the object. The default value is 0.9.

**Code Description**:
The `object_narsese` function takes in several parameters and returns a Narsese statement as a string. The Narsese statement is constructed by concatenating the given parameters in a specific format.

The Narsese statement is generated as follows:
- The Property and Class parameters are enclosed in square brackets and combined with an ampersand (&) to represent the property and class of the object.
- The xLabel and yLabel parameters are concatenated with a space to represent the x-label and y-label of the object.
- The Narsese statement is enclosed in angle brackets (<>) to indicate that it is a statement.
- The Confidence parameter, if provided, is converted to a string and appended to the Narsese statement with a confidence operator (:|:) and a confidence value in the format "{1.0 Confidence}".

The function returns the generated Narsese statement as a string.

This function is called by two objects in the project:
1. `detectionToNarseseStatementsList` in the `ona_darknet.py` file:
   - This function receives a detection object and extracts the necessary information such as position, label, and confidence.
   - It then calls the `object_narsese` function, passing the extracted information as parameters.
   - The generated Narsese statement is appended to a list and returned.

2. `detectionToNarseseStatementsList` in the `ona_visp_auto_tracker.py` file:
   - This function receives position and orientation information.
   - It determines the door state based on the z orientation value.
   - It calls the `object_narsese` function, passing the door state, "door" as the class, and the position information as parameters.
   - The generated Narsese statement is appended to a list and returned.

**Note**:
- The Confidence parameter is optional and has a default value of 0.9.
- The generated Narsese statement follows a specific format and should be used accordingly in the project.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with the following parameters:
- Property: "red"
- Class: "ball"
- xLabel: "A"
- yLabel: "B"
- Confidence: 0.8

The function will return the following Narsese statement:
"<([red] & ball) --> [A B]>. :|: {1.0 0.8}"
