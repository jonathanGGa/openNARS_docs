## _function detectionToNarseseStatementsList(detection)
**detectionToNarseseStatementsList**: The function of detectionToNarseseStatementsList is to convert a detection object into a list of Narsese statements.

**parameters**:
- detection: A dictionary representing a detection object. It should contain the following keys:
  - "label": A string representing the label or class of the detected object.
  - "confidence": A float representing the confidence level of the detection.
  - "boxes": A list containing the coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. It should have four elements in the following order: [x, y, width, height].

**Code Description**:
The detectionToNarseseStatementsList function takes in a detection object and converts it into a list of Narsese statements. It first extracts the necessary information from the detection object, such as the label, confidence, and bounding box coordinates. 

The function then calls the detectionPosition function to calculate the midpoint coordinates (x, y) of the bounding box. These midpoint coordinates are then passed to the foveaRelativePosition function to determine the relative position of the bounding box within a fovea. The discretizedSize function is also called to determine the size category of the object based on its width and height.

Using the extracted information and calculated values, the function calls the object_narsese function to generate a Narsese statement for each detection. The Narsese statement includes the size category, label, relative position, and confidence level of the object.

The generated Narsese statements are appended to a list, which is then returned as the output of the function.

**Note**:
- The detectionToNarseseStatementsList function assumes that the detection object is in the correct format and contains all the required keys. If the detection object is missing any key or has an incorrect format, the function may raise an error.
- The function relies on the detectionPosition, foveaRelativePosition, discretizedSize, and object_narsese functions to perform its calculations and generate the Narsese statements. Make sure these functions are properly implemented and available in the project.
- The Narsese statements generated by this function follow a specific format and may need to be processed further depending on the requirements of the project.

**Output Example**:
If the detection object is:
```
{
  "label": "cat",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "boxes": [100, 200, 50, 60]
}
```
The detectionToNarseseStatementsList function will return the following list of Narsese statements:
```
[
  "<([average] & cat) --> [centeredX centeredY]>. :|: {1.0 0.95}"
]
```
## _class NARSUtility
**NARSUtility**: The function of NARSUtility is to provide utility methods for processing data from the darknet_ros package and publishing NARSese statements.

**attributes**:
- `narsese_pub`: A ROS publisher object used to publish NARSese statements.
- `rate`: A ROS rate object used to control the publishing rate.

**Code Description**:
The `NARSUtility` class is responsible for processing data from the darknet_ros package and publishing NARSese statements. It initializes a ROS node with the name 'NARSUtility' and sets the anonymity flag to False. It also subscribes to the '/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes' topic, expecting messages of type `BoundingBoxes`. The `darknet_callback` function is called whenever a message is received on this topic.

In the `darknet_callback` function, the bounding boxes data is extracted from the received message. For each bounding box, a dictionary is created with the label, confidence, and box coordinates. This dictionary is then passed to the `detectionToNarseseStatementsList` function, which returns a list of NARSese statements. Each statement is published using the `narsese_pub` publisher.

The `NARSUtility` class also has an attribute `rate`, which is a ROS rate object initialized with a rate of 10 Hz. This rate is used to control the publishing frequency of NARSese statements.

**Note**:
- This class assumes that the ROS environment has been properly set up and the necessary packages (darknet_ros) are installed.
- The `detectionToNarseseStatementsList` function is not provided in the code snippet and should be implemented separately.
### _class_function __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the NARSUtility object.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is the constructor of the NARSUtility class. It is called when a new instance of the class is created. The function performs the following tasks:

1. Initializes the ROS node: The function calls the rospy.init_node() method to initialize the ROS node with the name 'NARSUtility'. The anonymous parameter is set to False, which means that the node will have a unique name.

2. Subscribes to the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic: The function creates a subscriber to the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic using the rospy.Subscriber() method. It passes the self.darknet_callback method as the callback function to be executed when new data is received on the topic. The data received from the topic is expected to be of type BoundingBoxes.

3. Initializes the Narsese publisher: The function creates a publisher object, self.narsese_pub, using the rospy.Publisher() method. The publisher is associated with the "/ona_ros/nars/narsese" topic and has a queue size of 1. This publisher will be used to publish Narsese statements.

4. Sets the publishing rate: The function sets the publishing rate to 10 Hz using the rospy.Rate() method. This rate determines how frequently the Narsese statements will be published.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function does not take any parameters.
- The function assumes that the necessary ROS packages and topics are properly configured in the project.
- The self.darknet_callback method is expected to be implemented and available in the project. It is responsible for processing the data received from the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic.
- The self.narsese_pub publisher is used to publish Narsese statements to the "/ona_ros/nars/narsese" topic. Make sure the topic is correctly configured and subscribed to by the relevant components in the project.
### _class_function darknet_callback(self, data)
**darknet_callback**: The function of darknet_callback is to process the data received from the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic and convert it into Narsese statements. These statements are then published to the "/ona_ros/nars/narsese" topic.

**parameters**:
- data: The data received from the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic. It should be of type BoundingBoxes.

**Code Description**:
The darknet_callback function takes in the data received from the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic and extracts the bounding box information from it. It then iterates over each bounding box and converts it into a dictionary format. This dictionary contains the label, confidence, and coordinates of the bounding box.

Next, the function calls the detectionToNarseseStatementsList function, passing the bounding box dictionary as a parameter. This function converts the bounding box into a list of Narsese statements. Each statement represents a detected object and includes information such as the label, confidence, and position of the object.

Finally, the function publishes each Narsese statement to the "/ona_ros/nars/narsese" topic using the self.narsese_pub.publish() method.

**Note**:
- The darknet_callback function assumes that the data received from the "/darknet_ros/bounding_boxes" topic is in the correct format and contains the necessary information. If the data is missing any required fields or has an incorrect format, the function may raise an error.
- The function relies on the detectionToNarseseStatementsList function to convert the bounding box into Narsese statements. Make sure this function is properly implemented and available in the project.
- The Narsese statements generated by this function are published to the "/ona_ros/nars/narsese" topic. Make sure the topic is correctly configured and subscribed to by the relevant components in the project.
