## _function distance(posX, posY, posX2, posY2)
**distance**: The function of distance is to calculate the maximum absolute difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two given points.

**parameters**:
- posX: The x-coordinate of the first point.
- posY: The y-coordinate of the first point.
- posX2: The x-coordinate of the second point.
- posY2: The y-coordinate of the second point.

**Code Description**:
The distance function takes in four parameters: posX, posY, posX2, and posY2. It calculates the difference between the x-coordinates (dx) and the difference between the y-coordinates (dy) of the two given points. The function then returns the maximum absolute difference between dx and dy.

This function is used to measure the distance between two points in a two-dimensional space. It can be used in various applications, such as determining the proximity of objects or calculating the distance between two locations.

In the project, this distance function is called in multiple places. 

In the code of the `Entity` class, the distance function is used to check the distance between the current entity and the traffic lights. If the distance is less than the radius of the traffic light, and the traffic light is red, the velocity of the entity is reduced. This ensures that the entity slows down when approaching a red traffic light.

The distance function is also used to check the distance between the current entity and other entities. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the velocity of the entity is reduced. This prevents entities from colliding with each other.

In the code of the `Camera` class, the distance function is used to determine if an entity is within the view radius of the camera. If an entity is within the view radius, the camera informs an informer object about the entity.

In the code of the `streetcolor` function, the distance function is used to calculate the distance between a given point and the position of the camera. If the distance is less than the view radius of the camera, the function returns a specific color code.

**Note**: 
- The distance function assumes a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
- The function returns the maximum absolute difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, which represents the maximum distance between the two points in either the x or y direction.
- The distance function does not take into account any units of measurement. It operates purely on the numerical values of the coordinates.
- The distance function does not perform any error checking or validation of the input parameters. It assumes that the input parameters are valid numerical values.

**Output Example**: 
If the input parameters are posX=1, posY=2, posX2=4, posY2=6, the distance function will calculate the differences dx=1-4=-3 and dy=2-6=-4. The maximum absolute difference between dx and dy is 4, so the function will return 4.
## _class Street
**Street**: The function of Street is to represent a street in a traffic prediction system.

**attributes**:
- forCarsOnly: A boolean value indicating whether the street is only for cars.
- startX: The x-coordinate of the starting point of the street.
- startY: The y-coordinate of the starting point of the street.
- endX: The x-coordinate of the ending point of the street.
- endY: The y-coordinate of the ending point of the street.

**Code Description**: The Street class is used to define and represent a street in a traffic prediction system. It has attributes to store the starting and ending coordinates of the street, as well as a flag to indicate whether the street is exclusively for cars.

The constructor method `__init__` is called when a new instance of the Street class is created. It takes five parameters: `forCarsOnly`, `startX`, `startY`, `endX`, and `endY`. These parameters are used to initialize the corresponding attributes of the Street object.

The `forCarsOnly` parameter is a boolean value that determines whether the street is only for cars. If set to `True`, it means that the street is exclusively for cars. If set to `False`, it means that the street can be used by other types of vehicles as well.

The `startX` and `startY` parameters represent the coordinates of the starting point of the street. These coordinates define the position where the street begins.

Similarly, the `endX` and `endY` parameters represent the coordinates of the ending point of the street. These coordinates define the position where the street ends.

Once the Street object is created, the constructor assigns the parameter values to the corresponding attributes of the object using the `self` keyword. This allows the object to store and access these values throughout its lifetime.

**Note**: When creating a new instance of the Street class, make sure to provide the appropriate values for the `forCarsOnly`, `startX`, `startY`, `endX`, and `endY` parameters. These values will be used to initialize the attributes of the Street object.

- isPredicted: A boolean value indicating whether the entity is predicted.
- lastPosX: An integer representing the last X-coordinate of the entity's position.
- lastPosY: An integer representing the last Y-coordinate of the entity's position.

**Constructor**:

- id: An integer representing the unique identifier of the entity.
- posX: A float value representing the X-coordinate of the entity's initial position.
- posY: A float value representing the Y-coordinate of the entity's initial position.
- velocity: A float value representing the initial velocity of the entity.
- angle: A float value representing the initial angle of the entity's movement.

**hasMoved**:
The hasMoved method determines whether the entity has moved based on its velocity. It calculates the distance traveled by the entity and returns True if the distance is greater than or equal to 0.1, indicating that the entity has moved. Otherwise, it returns False.

**simulate**:
The simulate method is responsible for simulating the movement of the entity in the traffic system. It takes in the current state of the traffic system, including the traffic lights, entities, and streets, and updates the position and velocity of the entity based on the current state.

The method starts by initializing a boolean variable called "accelerate" to True. This variable will be used to determine if the entity should accelerate.

Next, it checks the distance between the entity and each traffic light. If the distance is less than the radius of the traffic light and the traffic light is red, the velocity of the entity is reduced by multiplying it by 0.5. The "accelerate" variable is set to False to indicate that the entity should not accelerate.

Then, it checks the distance between the entity and each other entity. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the velocity of the entity is reduced by multiplying it by 0.8. The "accelerate" variable is set to False to indicate that the entity should not accelerate.

After that, if the "accelerate" variable is True and the velocity of the entity is less than the maximum speed, the velocity is increased by 0.02.

Next, the X and Y components of the acceleration are calculated based on the angle of the entity's movement.

Then, the position of the entity is updated by adding the X component of the acceleration multiplied by the velocity to the current X-coordinate, and adding the Y component of the acceleration multiplied by the velocity to the current Y-coordinate.

Finally, the position of the entity is checked to ensure that it stays within the boundaries of the traffic system. If the entity goes beyond the boundaries, its position is adjusted accordingly.

**Note**:
- The Entity class provides a basic representation of an entity in the traffic system.
- The simulate method assumes the existence of the distance function, which is used to calculate the distance between two points.
- The simulate method assumes the existence of the random module, which is used to generate random numbers.
- The simulate method assumes the existence of the math module, which is used for mathematical calculations.
- The simulate method assumes the existence of the trafficLights, entities, and streets variables, which represent the current state of the traffic system.

**Output Example**: 
If the entity's velocity is 0.5, the distance traveled by
### _class_function hasMoved(self)
**hasMoved**: The function of hasMoved is to determine whether the entity has moved based on its velocity.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The hasMoved function is a method that belongs to the Entity class. It calculates the distance traveled by the entity based on its velocity and determines whether it has moved. The function first assigns the value of the entity's velocity to the variable "dist". It then checks if the value of "dist" is greater than or equal to 0.1. If the condition is true, it means that the entity has moved and the function returns True. Otherwise, if the condition is false, it means that the entity has not moved and the function returns False.

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the velocity of the entity is already defined and accessible within the class.
- The value of 0.1 used in the comparison can be adjusted according to the specific requirements of the application.

**Output Example**:
- If the velocity of the entity is 0.5, the function will return True, indicating that the entity has moved.
- If the velocity of the entity is 0.05, the function will return False, indicating that the entity has not moved.
## _class Pedestrian
**Pedestrian**: The Pedestrian class represents a pedestrian entity in the traffic system. It is a subclass of the Entity class.

**Attributes**:
- prevX: The previous X-coordinate of the pedestrian.
- prevY: The previous Y-coordinate of the pedestrian.
- initialAngle: The initial angle of the pedestrian's movement.
- maxSpeed: The maximum speed of the pedestrian.

**simulate**:
The simulate method is responsible for simulating the movement of the pedestrian in the traffic system. It takes in the current state of the traffic system, including the traffic lights, entities, and streets, and updates the position and angle of the pedestrian based on the current state.

The method starts by calling the simulate method of the superclass Entity to perform common simulation tasks.

Next, it updates the angle of the pedestrian's movement by adding a random value between -0.05 and 0.05 to the current angle.

Then, it checks if the pedestrian is on a street that allows pedestrians. If not, it resets the angle, posX, and posY of the pedestrian to their previous values to prevent the pedestrian from going onto grass.

Finally, it updates the prevX and prevY attributes of the pedestrian with the current posX and posY values.

**Note**:
- The Pedestrian class inherits attributes and methods from the Entity class.
- The simulate method assumes the existence of the discretization variable, which is not defined in the given code snippet.


## _class Car
**Car**: The function of Car is to represent a car entity in the traffic prediction system.

**Attributes**:
- maxSpeed: A float value representing the maximum speed of the car.

**Code Description**:
The Car class is a subclass of the Entity class. It inherits all the attributes and methods from the Entity class and adds its own specific attributes and behavior.

The Car class has a single attribute called maxSpeed, which represents the maximum speed that a car can travel.

The Car class does not have any additional methods or behavior specific to cars. It inherits the methods from the Entity class, such as `hasMoved()` and `simulate()`, which are used to determine if the car has moved and to simulate its movement based on traffic lights, other entities, and streets.

**Note**:
- The maxSpeed attribute can be used to set the maximum speed of a car entity.
- The Car class inherits all the attributes and methods from the Entity class, allowing it to have the same basic functionality as any other entity in the system.
- The Car class can be used to represent cars in a traffic prediction system, where their movement and behavior can be simulated based on various factors such as traffic lights and other entities.
## _function positionToTerm(X, Y, discretization)
**positionToTerm**: The function of positionToTerm is to convert the given X and Y coordinates into a string representation of their corresponding position terms.

**parameters**:
- X: The X coordinate value.
- Y: The Y coordinate value.
- discretization: The discretization value used to divide the coordinates.

**Code Description**:
The `positionToTerm` function takes in three parameters: X, Y, and discretization. It first calculates the posX and posY values by dividing the X and Y coordinates by the discretization value and converting them to integers using the `int()` function. Then, it concatenates the posX and posY values with an underscore "_" in between, and returns the resulting string.

This function is used to convert continuous coordinates into discrete position terms. It is commonly used in applications that require discretization of spatial data, such as traffic prediction systems. By converting the coordinates into position terms, it becomes easier to represent and process the data in a discrete manner.

In the given code snippet, the `positionToTerm` function is called within the `informAboutEntity` method of the `OpenNARS-for-Applications\misc\Python\trafficpredict.py` file. The `informAboutEntity` method takes in the `ent`, `minX`, and `minY` parameters. It first checks if the `useMultipleIDs` flag is set to True, and if not, sets the `id` variable to "0". Then, it calculates the `pos` value by calling the `positionToTerm` function with the `ent.posX-minX`, `ent.posY-minY`, and `discretization` parameters. The resulting `pos` value is then used to append a string to the `inputs` list and update the `input` variable.

The `informAboutEntity` method is responsible for informing the system about an entity by generating a corresponding input string. The `pos` value, obtained using the `positionToTerm` function, represents the position of the entity relative to the minimum X and Y coordinates. This information is used to construct the input string in the format "(*, entityname(ent), pos). :|:".

**Note**: 
- The `positionToTerm` function assumes that the input coordinates and discretization value are valid and appropriate for the given application.
- The `informAboutEntity` method assumes that the `ent`, `minX`, `minY`, and `discretization` parameters are correctly provided.
- The `informAboutEntity` method assumes that the `entityname` function is defined and returns the name of the entity.

**Output Example**:
If the `positionToTerm` function is called with X=10, Y=20, and discretization=5, the function will return the string "2_4".
## _function entityname(ent)
**entityname**: The function of entityname is to generate a unique identifier for an entity.

**parameters**:
- ent: An object representing an entity.

**Code Description**:
The `entityname` function takes an entity object as input and generates a unique identifier for that entity. 

First, the function checks if the given entity is an instance of the `Car` class. If it is, the variable `C` is assigned the value "C". Otherwise, `C` is assigned the value "P". This is done using the `isinstance()` function, which checks if the given object is an instance of a specified class.

Next, the function appends the string representation of the entity's ID to `C`. The ID is obtained by accessing the `id` attribute of the entity object.

Finally, the function returns the concatenated string `C+str(ent.id)`, which represents the unique identifier for the entity.

**Note**:
- The `entityname` function is used to generate a unique identifier for an entity object.
- The function checks if the entity is an instance of the `Car` class and assigns the prefix "C" if it is, or "P" if it is not.
- The unique identifier is obtained by concatenating the prefix with the string representation of the entity's ID.

**Output Example**: 
- If `ent` is an instance of the `Car` class with ID 123, the function will return "C123".
- If `ent` is not an instance of the `Car` class with ID 456, the function will return "P456".
## _class InformPredictionNar
**InformPredictionNar**: The function of InformPredictionNar is to inform the prediction system about entities and traffic lights in a given environment.

**attributes**:
- `lastInput`: A string representing the last input fed into the reasoner.
- `input`: A string representing the current input to be fed into the reasoner.
- `inputs`: A list of strings representing the inputs to be fed into the reasoner.

**Code Description**:
The `InformPredictionNar` class provides methods to inform the prediction system about entities and traffic lights in a given environment. 

The `informAboutEntity` method takes an entity object, `ent`, and the minimum x and y coordinates, `minX` and `minY`, as parameters. It converts the entity's position to a term using the `positionToTerm` function and appends the resulting string to the `inputs` list. It also appends the same string to the `input` string. This method is used to inform the prediction system about the presence of an entity in the environment.

The `informAboutTrafficLight` method takes a traffic light object, `light`, and the minimum x and y coordinates, `minX` and `minY`, as parameters. It determines the color of the traffic light based on the value of `light.colour` and appends the corresponding string to the `inputs` list. It also appends the same string to the `input` string. This method is used to inform the prediction system about the state of a traffic light.

The `Input` method takes a boolean parameter, `force`, which indicates whether the inputs should be forced to be fed into the reasoner. It checks if the current input is different from the last input or if `force` is True. If either condition is True, it iterates over the `inputs` list and adds each input to the reasoner using the `NAR.AddInput` function. It then updates the `lastInput` with the current `input` and clears the `input` and `inputs` lists. Finally, it returns a boolean value indicating whether any input was added to the reasoner. This method is used to feed the inputs to the reasoner.

**Note**: 
- The `informAboutEntity` and `informAboutTrafficLight` methods are called to inform the prediction system about the entities and traffic lights in the environment.
- The `Input` method is called to feed the inputs to the reasoner.

**Output Example**: 
None
### _class_function informAboutEntity(self, ent, minX, minY)
**informAboutEntity**: The function of informAboutEntity is to inform the system about an entity by generating a corresponding input string.

**parameters**:
- ent: An object representing the entity.
- minX: The minimum X coordinate value.
- minY: The minimum Y coordinate value.

**Code Description**:
The `informAboutEntity` function is a method of the `InformPredictionNar` class in the `trafficpredict.py` file. It takes in three parameters: `ent`, `minX`, and `minY`. 

The function first converts the `ent.id` value to a string and assigns it to the `id` variable. The `useMultipleIDs` flag is then checked, and if it is set to True, the `id` variable remains unchanged. However, if `useMultipleIDs` is False, the `id` variable is set to "0".

Next, the function calls the `positionToTerm` function with the `ent.posX-minX`, `ent.posY-minY`, and `discretization` parameters to calculate the `pos` value. The `positionToTerm` function converts the given X and Y coordinates into a string representation of their corresponding position terms.

The `pos` value is then used to construct an input string in the format "(*, entityname(ent), pos). :|:". The `entityname` function is assumed to be defined and returns the name of the entity. The constructed input string is appended to the `inputs` list and also added to the `input` variable.

The `informAboutEntity` function is responsible for generating an input string that informs the system about the entity's position. By using the `positionToTerm` function, the continuous coordinates of the entity are converted into discrete position terms. This allows for easier representation and processing of the entity's position in a discrete manner.

**Note**:
- The `informAboutEntity` function assumes that the `ent`, `minX`, and `minY` parameters are correctly provided.
- The `informAboutEntity` function assumes that the `positionToTerm` and `entityname` functions are defined and return the expected results.
- The `informAboutEntity` function assumes that the `useMultipleIDs` flag is correctly set according to the desired behavior.

The `informAboutEntity` function is called within the `see` method of the `Camera` class in the `trafficpredict.py` file. The `see` method iterates over a list of entities and checks if their distance from the camera's position is within the view radius. If so, the `informAboutEntity` function is called to inform the system about the entity. The `minX` and `minY` values are passed as parameters to ensure the correct calculation of the entity's position.

Additionally, the `informAboutEntity` function is called within the `informAboutTrafficLight` method of the `Camera` class. This method is called when a traffic light is switched on. The `informAboutEntity` function is used to inform the system about the traffic light's position.

The `informAboutEntity` function is an essential part of the traffic prediction system, as it provides the necessary input to the system for accurate prediction and analysis of entity positions.
### _class_function informAboutTrafficLight(self, light, minX, minY)
**informAboutTrafficLight**: The function of informAboutTrafficLight is to inform the system about the state of a traffic light.

**parameters**:
- light: The traffic light object that contains information about the color of the light.
- minX: The minimum x-coordinate of the traffic light's location.
- minY: The minimum y-coordinate of the traffic light's location.

**Code Description**:
The informAboutTrafficLight function takes in a traffic light object, its minimum x-coordinate, and its minimum y-coordinate as parameters. It first checks the color of the traffic light by comparing the value of light.colour. If the color is 0, it sets the variable "colour" to "green", otherwise it sets it to "red".

Next, it constructs a Narsese string by concatenating the value of "colour" with ". :|:". This string represents the state of the traffic light in a NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) format.

The constructed Narsese string is then appended to the "inputs" list and added to the "input" string of the current object.

**Note**: 
- The informAboutTrafficLight function is used to inform the system about the state of a traffic light. It is called by the "see" function of the "Camera" object in the project.
- The "see" function iterates over a list of entities and checks if their distance from the camera is within the view radius. If so, it calls the informAboutEntity function of the "informer" object to inform the system about the entity.
- After processing the entities, the "see" function also checks if any of the traffic lights have been switched on. If so, it calls the informAboutTrafficLight function of the "informer" object to inform the system about the traffic light.
- The "see" function returns the "input" string of the "informer" object.
### _class_function Input(self, force)
**Input**: The function of Input is to process the input data and send it to the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system for further processing.

**Parameters**:
- force: A boolean value indicating whether to force the input to be processed, even if it is the same as the last input.

**Code Description**:
The Input function is responsible for handling the input data and sending it to the NAR system for processing. It takes a boolean parameter "force" which determines whether the input should be processed even if it is the same as the last input.

The function starts by initializing a boolean variable "hadInput" to False. This variable will be used to keep track of whether any input was processed.

Next, the function checks if the current input is different from the last input or if the "force" parameter is set to True. If either of these conditions is true, the function proceeds to process the input.

Inside the processing loop, the function iterates over each input in the "inputs" list. For each input, it calls the "AddInput" function from the NAR module and passes the input as a parameter. This function is responsible for sending the Narsese input to the NAR system and processing the output. If any input is processed, the "hadInput" variable is set to True.

After processing all the inputs, the function updates the "lastInput" variable with the current input, indicating that it has been processed.

Finally, the function resets the "input" variable to an empty string and clears the "inputs" list. It then returns the value of the "hadInput" variable, indicating whether any input was processed.

**Note**:
- The Input function assumes that the NAR system is already running and accessible.
- The function relies on the "AddInput" function from the NAR module to process the input data.
- The "force" parameter allows the user to override the check for the same input and force the processing of the input.
- The function updates the "lastInput" variable to keep track of the last processed input.

**Output Example**:
If the input data is different from the last input or the "force" parameter is set to True, the function will process the input and return True. Otherwise, it will return False.
## _class Camera
**Camera**: The function of Camera is to represent a camera object in a traffic prediction system. It has attributes to store the position and view radius of the camera, and a method to detect entities and traffic lights within its view radius and inform the prediction system about them.

**attributes**:
- `radius`: An integer representing the radius of the camera.
- `viewradius`: An integer representing the view radius of the camera.
- `posX`: An integer representing the x-coordinate of the camera's position.
- `posY`: An integer representing the y-coordinate of the camera's position.
- `minX`: An integer representing the minimum x-coordinate of the camera's view area.
- `minY`: An integer representing the minimum y-coordinate of the camera's view area.
- `informer`: An instance of the InformPredictionNar class used to inform the prediction system.

**Code Description**:
The `Camera` class represents a camera object in a traffic prediction system. It has an `__init__` method that initializes the camera's position and calculates the minimum x and y coordinates of its view area based on its radius. It also creates an instance of the `InformPredictionNar` class to inform the prediction system.

The `see` method takes three parameters: `entities`, `trafficLights`, and `force`. It iterates over the `entities` list and checks if each entity is within the camera's view radius. If an entity is within the view radius, it calls the `informAboutEntity` method of the `informer` object to inform the prediction system about the entity.

Next, it iterates over the `trafficLights` list and checks if each traffic light is switched on. If a traffic light is switched on, it calls the `informAboutTrafficLight` method of the `informer` object to inform the prediction system about the traffic light. It then breaks out of the loop, as only one traffic light needs to be informed.

Finally, it calls the `Input` method of the `informer` object with the `force` parameter and returns the result. The `Input` method feeds the inputs to the prediction system and returns a boolean value indicating whether any input was added.

**Note**:
- The `see` method is called to detect entities and traffic lights within the camera's view radius and inform the prediction system about them.
- The `informer` object is used to inform the prediction system about entities and traffic lights.

**Output Example**:
True
### _class_function see(self, entities, trafficLights, force)
**see**: The function of see is to process the entities and traffic lights within the camera's view radius and inform the system about their presence.

**parameters**:
- entities: A list of objects representing entities.
- trafficLights: A list of objects representing traffic lights.
- force: A boolean value indicating whether to force the input to be processed, even if it is the same as the last input.

**Code Description**:
The `see` function is a method of the `Camera` class in the `trafficpredict.py` file. It takes in three parameters: `entities`, `trafficLights`, and `force`.

The function first iterates over the `entities` list and checks if the distance between the camera's position and each entity's position is within the camera's view radius. If the distance is within the view radius, the function calls the `informAboutEntity` function of the `informer` object to inform the system about the entity's position. The `minX` and `minY` values are passed as parameters to ensure the correct calculation of the entity's position.

Next, the function iterates over the `trafficLights` list and checks if any of the traffic lights have been switched on. If a traffic light is switched on, the function calls the `informAboutTrafficLight` function of the `informer` object to inform the system about the traffic light's state. The `minX` and `minY` values are passed as parameters to ensure the correct calculation of the traffic light's position.

After processing the entities and traffic lights, the function returns the result of calling the `Input` function of the `informer` object with the `force` parameter.

The `see` function plays a crucial role in the traffic prediction system. It processes the entities and traffic lights within the camera's view radius and generates the necessary input for the system to make accurate predictions and analysis.

**Note**:
- The `see` function assumes that the `entities` and `trafficLights` parameters are correctly provided as lists of objects.
- The `see` function relies on the `informAboutEntity` and `informAboutTrafficLight` functions of the `informer` object to inform the system about the entities and traffic lights.
- The `see` function also relies on the `Input` function of the `informer` object to process the generated input and send it to the NAR system.
- The `see` function assumes that the `informer` object is correctly initialized and accessible.

**Output Example**:
If the `entities` list contains two entities within the camera's view radius and one traffic light is switched on, the `see` function will generate the corresponding input strings and return the result of calling the `Input` function.
## _class TrafficLight
**TrafficLight**: The function of TrafficLight is to simulate the behavior of a traffic light, including changing its color at regular intervals.

**attributes**:
- id: The unique identifier of the traffic light.
- radius: The radius of the traffic light.
- posX: The X-coordinate position of the traffic light.
- posY: The Y-coordinate position of the traffic light.
- colour: The current color of the traffic light.

**Code Description**:
The TrafficLight class represents a traffic light in a simulation. It has several attributes, including id, radius, positionX, positionY, and colour. The id is a unique identifier for the traffic light, while the radius determines the size of the traffic light. The positionX and positionY attributes specify the coordinates of the traffic light on a two-dimensional plane. The colour attribute represents the current color of the traffic light.

The class has a constructor method (__init__) that initializes the attributes of the traffic light object. It takes five parameters: id, radius, positionX, positionY, and colour. These parameters are used to set the corresponding attributes of the object.

The simulate method is the main function of the TrafficLight class. It simulates the behavior of the traffic light by changing its color at regular intervals. The method takes three parameters: trafficLights, entities, and streets. These parameters represent the other objects in the simulation that the traffic light interacts with.

Inside the simulate method, the switched attribute is set to False initially. This attribute keeps track of whether the traffic light has switched its color during the simulation.

The method then checks if the current time (t) is divisible by 200. If it is, the color of the traffic light is changed by incrementing the colour attribute by 1 and taking the modulo 2. This ensures that the color alternates between 0 (GREEN) and 1 (RED). The switched attribute is set to True to indicate that the traffic light has switched its color.

Finally, the t attribute is incremented by 1 to keep track of the simulation time.

**Note**:
- The TrafficLight class represents a single traffic light in a simulation.
- The simulate method is called periodically to update the state of the traffic light.
- The color of the traffic light alternates between GREEN and RED every 200 simulation time units.
- The switched attribute can be used to determine if the traffic light has switched its color during the simulation.
### _class_function __init__(self, id, radius, positionX, positionY, colour)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TrafficLight object with the provided parameters.

**parameters**:
- id: An identifier for the TrafficLight object.
- radius: The radius of the TrafficLight.
- positionX: The X-coordinate of the TrafficLight's position.
- positionY: The Y-coordinate of the TrafficLight's position.
- colour: The color of the TrafficLight.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when a new instance of the TrafficLight class is created. It takes in the parameters id, radius, positionX, positionY, and colour, and assigns them to the corresponding attributes of the TrafficLight object.

The id parameter is used to uniquely identify the TrafficLight object. The radius parameter specifies the size of the TrafficLight. The positionX and positionY parameters determine the position of the TrafficLight on a two-dimensional plane. The colour parameter specifies the color of the TrafficLight.

Inside the function, the provided parameters are assigned to the corresponding attributes of the TrafficLight object using the self keyword. The self keyword refers to the instance of the class and allows access to its attributes and methods.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide valid values for all the parameters when creating a new instance of the TrafficLight class.
- The id, radius, positionX, positionY, and colour attributes can be accessed and modified using dot notation (e.g., traffic_light.id, traffic_light.radius).
### _class_function simulate(self, trafficLights, entities, streets)
**simulate**: The function of simulate is to simulate the movement of an entity (such as a car or pedestrian) in the traffic system.

**parameters**:
- trafficLights: A list of traffic light objects in the system.
- entities: A list of entity objects (cars and pedestrians) in the system.
- streets: A list of street objects in the system.

**Code Description**:
The simulate function is responsible for simulating the movement of an entity in the traffic system. It takes in the current state of the traffic system, including the traffic lights, entities, and streets, and updates the position and velocity of the entity based on the current state.

The function starts by initializing a boolean variable called "switched" to False. This variable will be used to keep track of whether the traffic light has switched its color. 

Next, the function checks if the current time step (t) is a multiple of 200. If it is, the color of the traffic light is switched by incrementing the "colour" variable by 1 and taking the modulo 2. This ensures that the traffic light alternates between two colors. The "switched" variable is set to True to indicate that the traffic light has switched its color.

Finally, the time step (t) is incremented by 1.

**Note**: 
- The simulate function assumes that the entity has a "t" attribute to keep track of the current time step.
- The simulate function assumes that the entity has a "colour" attribute to store the current color of the traffic light.
- The simulate function assumes that the entity has a "t" attribute to keep track of the current time step.
- The simulate function assumes that the entity has a "t" attribute to keep track of the current time step.
## _function cycle
**cycle**: The function of cycle is to iterate over a list of cameras, call the `see` function of each camera, and then simulate the movement of entities and traffic lights.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `cycle` function is a top-level function that does not take any parameters. It begins by initializing a boolean variable called `hadInput` to False.

Next, it enters a loop that iterates over each `c` in the `cameras` list. Within this loop, the variable `force` is set to True.

The code then calls the `see` function of the current camera `c` and passes in the `entities`, `trafficLights`, and `force` parameters. This function processes the entities and traffic lights within the camera's view radius and informs the system about their presence.

After processing the entities and traffic lights for the current camera, the code enters another loop that iterates over each `e` in the concatenation of the `entities` and `trafficLights` lists. Within this loop, the `simulate` function of the current entity `e` is called, passing in the `trafficLights`, `entities`, and `streets` parameters. This function simulates the movement of the entity in the traffic system.

The `cycle` function does not return any value.

**Note**:
- The `cycle` function assumes that the `cameras`, `entities`, `trafficLights`, and `streets` variables are correctly initialized and accessible.
- The `cycle` function relies on the `see` function of the `Camera` class to process the entities and traffic lights within the camera's view radius.
- The `cycle` function relies on the `simulate` function of the `Entity` class to simulate the movement of entities in the traffic system.
- The `cycle` function assumes that the `see` and `simulate` functions are correctly implemented and accessible.
- The `cycle` function assumes that the `entities`, `trafficLights`, and `streets` variables are correctly provided as lists of objects.
## _function streetcolor(x, y)
**streetcolor**: The function of streetcolor is to determine the color of a street based on the given coordinates (x, y) and the position of a camera.

**parameters**:
- x: The x-coordinate of the point on the street.
- y: The y-coordinate of the point on the street.

**Code Description**:
The streetcolor function takes in two parameters, x and y, which represent the coordinates of a point on a street. The function iterates through a list of streets and checks if the given coordinates (x, y) fall within the range of each street's start and end coordinates. If the coordinates fall within a street's range, the function proceeds to check the distance between the given coordinates and the position of the first camera in a list called "cameras".

To calculate the distance between the given coordinates and the camera's position, the function calls the distance function from the trafficpredict.py module. The distance function calculates the maximum absolute difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two given points. In this case, it calculates the distance between the given coordinates (x, y) and the camera's position (cameras[0].posX, cameras[0].posY).

If the calculated distance is less than the view radius of the camera (cameras[0].viewradius), the function returns the color code "\x1b[47m", which represents a specific background color. Otherwise, if the distance is greater than or equal to the view radius, the function returns the color code "\x1b[43m", which represents a different background color. If the given coordinates do not fall within any street's range, the function returns an empty string.

The streetcolor function is designed to be used in a traffic prediction application. It helps determine the color of a street based on the given coordinates and the position of a camera. This information can be used to visualize the proximity of a point on the street to the camera's view radius. The different colors represent different levels of proximity, with the color "\x1b[47m" indicating a closer distance and the color "\x1b[43m" indicating a farther distance.

**Note**:
- The streetcolor function assumes that the streets, cameras, and their properties (startX, endX, startY, endY, posX, posY, viewradius) are defined and accessible within the scope of the function.
- The function relies on the distance function from the trafficpredict.py module to calculate the distance between the given coordinates and the camera's position.
- The color codes "\x1b[47m" and "\x1b[43m" are ANSI escape codes that represent specific background colors. These codes may not be supported or displayed correctly in all environments.
- The function returns an empty string if the given coordinates do not fall within any street's range.

**Output Example**:
If the input parameters are x=3 and y=5, and the distance between these coordinates and the camera's position is less than the view radius, the streetcolor function will return "\x1b[47m", indicating a closer proximity to the camera.
## _function drawIDtoDirectionIndicator(drawid)
**drawIDtoDirectionIndicator**: The function of drawIDtoDirectionIndicator is to convert a given drawid into a corresponding direction indicator symbol.

**parameters**:
- drawid: A string representing the drawid.

**Code Description**:
The drawIDtoDirectionIndicator function takes a drawid as input and converts it into a corresponding direction indicator symbol. It uses a series of if statements to check the value of drawid and assigns the appropriate symbol based on the following conditions:
- If drawid is equal to "1", the function assigns the symbol "^" to drawid.
- If drawid is equal to "2", the function assigns the symbol "v" to drawid.
- If drawid is equal to "3", the function assigns the symbol ">" to drawid.
- If drawid is equal to "4", the function assigns the symbol "<" to drawid.

Finally, the function returns the updated value of drawid.

**Note**:
- The drawid parameter should be a string representing the drawid.
- The function assumes that the drawid will always be one of the values "1", "2", "3", or "4". If the drawid is not one of these values, the function will not assign any symbol and the original drawid value will be returned.

**Output Example**:
- Example 1:
  - Input: drawid = "1"
  - Output: "^"
- Example 2:
  - Input: drawid = "3"
  - Output: ">"
