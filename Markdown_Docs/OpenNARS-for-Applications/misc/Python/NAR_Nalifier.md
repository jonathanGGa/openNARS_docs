## _function ProcessNARret(ret)
**ProcessNARret**: The function of ProcessNARret is to process the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) return value and extract relevant information from it.

**Parameters**:
- `ret`: The NAR return value to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The ProcessNARret function takes the NAR return value `ret` as input and performs operations to extract relevant information from it. 

The function first checks if the "derivations" key is present in the `ret` dictionary and if it is not empty. If this condition is satisfied, the function iterates over each derivation in the "derivations" list.

For each derivation, the function checks if the "punctuation" key is equal to "!". If this condition is satisfied, the function further checks if the "term" key contains the string " --> " and "[". If this condition is also satisfied, the function extracts the property of interest from the "term" key.

The property of interest is obtained by splitting the "term" string using the " --> " separator, and then splitting the second part of the resulting list using "[" and "]" as separators. The extracted property is assigned to the variable `prop`.

Finally, the function calls the ShellInput function from the Nalifier object, passing the "*PROPERTY_OF_INTEREST=" concatenated with the extracted property as the input.

**Note**:
- The ProcessNARret function is responsible for processing the NAR return value and extracting the property of interest from the derivations.
- The function checks if the "derivations" key is present and not empty in the `ret` dictionary.
- For each derivation, the function checks if the "punctuation" key is equal to "!" and if the "term" key contains the required separators.
- The function extracts the property of interest from the "term" key and passes it to the ShellInput function for further processing.
- The function does not return any value.

**Output Example**:
If the `ret` dictionary contains the following structure:
```
{
    "derivations": [
        {
            "punctuation": "!",
            "term": "A --> [property]"
        },
        {
            "punctuation": "?",
            "term": "B --> [property]"
        }
    ]
}
```
The ProcessNARret function will call the ShellInput function with the input "*PROPERTY_OF_INTEREST=property".
