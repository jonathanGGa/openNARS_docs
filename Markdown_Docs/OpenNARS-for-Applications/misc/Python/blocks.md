## _function sim_step
**sim_step**: The function of sim_step is to simulate a step in a block world environment. 

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The sim_step function is responsible for simulating a step in a block world environment. It iterates through a list of objects and their locations. For each object, it determines the relative location of the object with respect to the self position. It then calls the AddInput function from the NAR module to add a Narsese input representing the object and its relative location to the NAR system.

After adding the inputs, the function calls the AddInput function again to add a Narsese input "G! :|:" to the NAR system. It retrieves the executions from the output of the AddInput function and appends them to the executions list. It then adds another Narsese input "10" to the NAR system and retrieves the executions again, appending them to the executions list.

If there are any executions in the list, the function checks the operator of the first execution. If the operator is "^left", it updates the self position to "left" if the current self position is "centered", or to "centered" if the current self position is "right". If the operator is "^right", it updates the self position to "right" if the current self position is "centered", or to "centered" if the current self position is "left".

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the objects and selfpos variables are defined and accessible within the same module.
- The function relies on the AddInput function from the NAR module to communicate with the NAR system.
- The function assumes that the NAR system is already running and its standard input and output streams are accessible.
- The function assumes that the AddInput function is defined and accessible within the same module as the sim_step function.
