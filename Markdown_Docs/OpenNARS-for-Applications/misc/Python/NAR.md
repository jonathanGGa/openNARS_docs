## _function spawnNAR
**spawnNAR**: The function of spawnNAR is to spawn a new NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) process.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `spawnNAR` function is responsible for creating a new NAR process. It uses the `subprocess.Popen` method to execute the NAR program with the specified arguments. The arguments passed to the `Popen` method are `["./../../NAR", "shell"]`, which represent the command to run the NAR program with the "shell" argument.

The `subprocess.Popen` method is a Python built-in function that allows the execution of external programs. It creates a new process and returns a `Popen` object that represents the running process. In this case, the `Popen` object is configured with the following parameters:
- `stdin=subprocess.PIPE`: This parameter specifies that the standard input of the new process should be redirected to a pipe. This allows communication between the parent process and the spawned NAR process.
- `stdout=subprocess.PIPE`: This parameter specifies that the standard output of the new process should be redirected to a pipe. This allows capturing the output of the NAR process.
- `universal_newlines=True`: This parameter ensures that the input and output streams are treated as text streams, allowing for easier handling of text-based communication.

The `spawnNAR` function returns the `Popen` object representing the spawned NAR process.

**Note**:
- The `spawnNAR` function assumes that the NAR program is located at the relative path `"./../../NAR"`. Make sure the correct path is provided to the NAR program.
- The `spawnNAR` function relies on the availability of the `subprocess` module in Python. Ensure that the module is installed or accessible in the Python environment where this code is executed.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the return value of the `spawnNAR` function is a `Popen` object representing the spawned NAR process. This object can be used to interact with the NAR process, such as sending input and reading output.
## _function getNAR
**getNAR**: The function of getNAR is to return the NARproc object.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The getNAR function is a simple function that returns the NARproc object. The NARproc object is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase and is being accessed through this function.

From the code snippet provided, it can be inferred that the NARproc object is a global variable or an object that is accessible from the current scope. The purpose of encapsulating the access to the NARproc object in this function is to provide a standardized way of obtaining it.

This function does not perform any complex operations or modifications to the NARproc object. It simply returns it as is.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the NARproc object is defined and accessible before calling this function. Otherwise, it may result in an error.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value:
NARproc
## _function setNAR(proc)
**setNAR**: The function of setNAR is to assign a value to the global variable NARproc.

**parameters**:
- proc: This parameter represents the value that will be assigned to the global variable NARproc.

**Code Description**:
The setNAR function is a simple function that takes a single parameter, proc, and assigns its value to the global variable NARproc. By using the "global" keyword, the function ensures that the assignment is made to the global variable and not a local variable with the same name.

This function is useful when there is a need to update the value of the NARproc variable from within a different scope or module. By calling setNAR and passing the desired value as the proc parameter, the global variable NARproc can be easily updated.

**Note**:
- It is important to note that the setNAR function does not return any value. Its purpose is solely to update the value of the global variable NARproc.
- The global keyword is used to indicate that the variable being assigned is a global variable and not a local variable. This ensures that the assignment is made to the intended variable in the global scope.
## _function terminateNAR(usedNAR)
**terminateNAR**: The function of terminateNAR is to terminate the NAR process.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR: This parameter is optional and represents the NAR process. It is set to the default value of NARproc.

**Code Description**:
The `terminateNAR` function is responsible for terminating the NAR process. It uses the `os.killpg` function to send a termination signal (SIGTERM) to the process group ID (PGID) of the specified NAR process.

The `os.killpg` function is used to send a signal to a process group. In this case, it is used to send the SIGTERM signal, which is the termination signal, to the process group ID of the NAR process. The process group ID is obtained using the `os.getpgid` function, which returns the process group ID of the specified process.

By terminating the NAR process, any ongoing computations or tasks performed by the NAR system will be stopped.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the `usedNAR` parameter is correctly set to the NAR process that needs to be terminated. If not specified, the default value of NARproc will be used, which may not be the desired process.
- The termination of the NAR process may result in the loss of any unsaved data or incomplete computations. It is recommended to save any necessary data before calling this function.
## _function parseTruth(T)
**parseTruth**: The function of parseTruth is to extract the frequency and confidence values from a given string.

**parameters**:
- T: A string containing the truth value in the format "frequency=<value> confidence=<value> dt=<value> occurrenceTime=<value>"

**Code Description**:
The parseTruth function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the extracted frequency and confidence values. 

The function first splits the input string using the "frequency=" substring as the delimiter. The second element of the resulting list is then split using the " confidence" substring as the delimiter. The first element of this new list is the extracted frequency value. The function removes any commas from the frequency value using the replace method.

Next, the input string is split using the " confidence=" substring as the delimiter. The second element of the resulting list is then split using the " dt=" substring as the delimiter. The first element of this new list is the extracted confidence value.

The extracted frequency and confidence values are then stored in a dictionary with the keys "frequency" and "confidence" respectively. The dictionary is returned as the output of the function.

The parseTruth function is called by the parseTask function in the OpenNARS-for-Applications\misc\Python\NAR.py/parseTask object. The parseTask function extracts various properties from a given string, including the truth value. If the input string contains the substring "Truth: ", the parseTruth function is called to extract the frequency and confidence values from the truth value.

**Note**:
- The input string must be in the format "frequency=<value> confidence=<value> dt=<value> occurrenceTime=<value>" for the function to extract the frequency and confidence values correctly.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "frequency=0.8 confidence=0.9 dt=0.5 occurrenceTime=now", the parseTruth function will return the following dictionary:
{"frequency": "0.8", "confidence": "0.9"}
## _function parseTask(s)
**parseTask**: The function of parseTask is to extract various properties from a given string and store them in a dictionary.

**parameters**:
- s: A string containing the properties to be extracted.

**Code Description**:
The parseTask function takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the extracted properties. 

The function first initializes a dictionary called M with a default value for the "occurrenceTime" property set to "eternal".

Next, the function checks if the input string contains the substring " :|:". If it does, it updates the value of the "occurrenceTime" property in the M dictionary to "now" and removes the " :|:" substring from the input string.

If the input string also contains the substring "occurrenceTime=", the function extracts the value of the "occurrenceTime" property from the input string and updates the value of the "occurrenceTime" property in the M dictionary accordingly.

The function then checks if the input string contains the substring "Stamp". If it does, it extracts the value of the "Stamp" property from the input string using the ast.literal_eval function, which evaluates the string as a Python expression and returns the corresponding object.

Next, the function extracts the sentence from the input string. If the input string contains the substring " occurrenceTime=", the sentence is extracted up to that substring. Otherwise, the sentence is extracted up to the first occurrence of any of the substrings " Stamp=", " Priority=", or " creationTime=".

The function then extracts the value of the "punctuation" property from the sentence. If the sentence contains the substring ":|:", the value of the "punctuation" property is set to the character at the fourth-to-last position of the sentence. Otherwise, it is set to the last character of the sentence.

The function further extracts the value of the "term" property from the sentence. It removes any occurrences of the substrings " creationTime", " occurrenceTime", " Truth", and " Stamp=" from the sentence, and removes the last character from the resulting string.

If the input string contains the substring "Truth", the function calls the parseTruth function to extract the frequency and confidence values from the input string and stores them in the M dictionary with the keys "frequency" and "confidence" respectively.

If the input string contains the substring "Priority", the function extracts the value of the "Priority" property from the input string and stores it in the M dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the M dictionary containing the extracted properties.

The parseTask function is called by the parseReason and GetOutput objects in the OpenNARS-for-Applications\misc\Python\NAR.py module. It is used to extract properties from strings representing reasons and outputs respectively.

**Note**:
- The input string must be in a specific format for the function to extract the properties correctly.
- The parseTruth function is called to extract the frequency and confidence values from the input string if it contains the substring "Truth: ".

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "occurrenceTime=now Stamp=[1, 2, 3] Priority=high", the parseTask function will return the following dictionary:
{"occurrenceTime": "now", "Stamp": [1, 2, 3], "punctuation": "=", "term": "occurrenceTime", "Priority": "high"}
## _function parseReason(sraw)
**parseReason**: The function of parseReason is to extract various properties from a given string representing a reason and store them in a dictionary.

**parameters**:
- sraw: A string representing a reason.

**Code Description**:
The parseReason function takes a string representing a reason as input and returns a dictionary containing the extracted properties.

The function first checks if the input string contains the substring "implication: ". If it does not, the function returns None.

If the input string contains the substring "implication: ", the function extracts the value of the "Implication" property from the input string using the parseTask function. The parseTask function is called with the substring after "implication: " and before "precondition: " as the input. The resulting dictionary is assigned to the variable Implication.

Next, the function extracts the value of the "Precondition" property from the input string using the parseTask function. The parseTask function is called with the substring after "precondition: " and before the first occurrence of a newline character as the input. The resulting dictionary is assigned to the variable Precondition.

The function then sets the "occurrenceTime" property of the Implication dictionary to "eternal".

The function further sets the "punctuation" property of both the Implication and Precondition dictionaries to ".".

Finally, the function creates a dictionary called Reason and assigns the value of the "decision expectation" property from the input string to the "desire" property of the Reason dictionary. The value of the Implication dictionary is assigned to the "hypothesis" property of the Reason dictionary, and the value of the Precondition dictionary is assigned to the "precondition" property of the Reason dictionary. The Reason dictionary is then returned.

**Note**:
- The input string must be in a specific format for the function to extract the properties correctly.
- The parseTask function is called to extract the Implication and Precondition properties from the input string.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "implication: occurrenceTime=now\nprecondition: occurrenceTime=eternal\ndecision expectation=high", the parseReason function will return the following dictionary:
{"desire": "high", "hypothesis": {"occurrenceTime": "now"}, "precondition": {"occurrenceTime": "eternal"}}
## _function parseExecution(e)
**parseExecution**: The function of parseExecution is to parse the execution information from a given string.

**parameters**:
- e: A string representing the execution information.

**Code Description**:
The parseExecution function takes a string as input and parses the execution information from it. It first checks if the string contains the substring "args ". If not, it returns a dictionary with the "operator" key set to the first word in the string and the "arguments" key set to an empty list.

If the string contains the substring "args ", it splits the string by spaces and retrieves the first word as the "operator". It then splits the string by the substring "args " and retrieves the second part. This second part is further split by the substring "{SELF} * " to remove the leading "{SELF} * " and the trailing character, which is assumed to be a closing bracket. The resulting string is assigned to the "arguments" key in the dictionary.

The function finally returns the dictionary with the "operator" and "arguments" keys set according to the parsed information.

This function is called within the GetOutput function in the NAR.py file. In the GetOutput function, the parseExecution function is used to parse the execution information from each line in a list of strings. The lines are filtered based on a specific condition, and the parseExecution function is applied to each filtered line using a list comprehension. The parsed execution information is then stored in a list.

**Note**:
- The parseExecution function assumes that the input string follows a specific format where the operator and arguments are separated by spaces and the arguments are enclosed in curly braces.
- The function expects the input string to contain the substring "args " if it contains any arguments.
- The function does not handle cases where the input string does not follow the expected format. In such cases, the behavior of the function is undefined.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "add args {SELF} * {a, b}", the function will return the following dictionary:
{
  "operator": "add",
  "arguments": "a, b"
}
## _function GetRawOutput(usedNAR)
**GetRawOutput**: The function of GetRawOutput is to retrieve the raw output from the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR: An instance of the NAR system.

**Code Description**:
The GetRawOutput function takes an instance of the NAR system as input and retrieves the raw output generated by the system. It communicates with the NAR system through its standard input and output streams.

The function starts by writing "0\n" to the standard input of the NAR system, which represents a command to retrieve the raw output. It then flushes the standard input to ensure the command is sent immediately.

A variable named "ret" is initialized as an empty string to store the output received from the NAR system. Another variable named "before" is initialized as an empty list to store the lines of output before the expected output is reached. A boolean variable named "requestOutputArgs" is set to False initially.

The function enters a while loop that continues until the string "done with 0 additional inference steps." is received from the NAR system. Within the loop, the function checks if the received output is not empty and appends it to the "before" list. It also checks if the received output is equal to "//Operation result product expected:". If this condition is met, it sets the "requestOutputArgs" variable to True and breaks out of the loop.

The function reads the next line of output from the NAR system using the stdout.readline() method and assigns it to the "ret" variable.

Finally, the function returns the "before" list excluding the last element (which is the expected output) and the value of the "requestOutputArgs" variable.

From a functional perspective, the GetRawOutput function is called by multiple objects in the project. The GetOutput function calls GetRawOutput to retrieve the raw output and then parses the output to extract different types of information such as executions, inputs, derivations, answers, selections, and reason. The GetStats function also calls GetRawOutput to retrieve the raw output and then extracts statistical information from the output. The AddInput function calls GetRawOutput to retrieve the raw output and then either prints it or returns it along with other parsed information.

**Note**: 
- The GetRawOutput function assumes that the NAR system is already running and its standard input and output streams are accessible.
- The function expects the NAR system to generate the output in a specific format, where "//Operation result product expected:" is used as a marker to indicate that the expected output is about to be generated.
- The function assumes that the NAR system will eventually generate the string "done with 0 additional inference steps." to indicate the completion of the output generation process.

**Output Example**:
```python
before = [
    "Some line of output 1",
    "Some line of output 2",
    "Some line of output 3"
]
requestOutputArgs = True
```
## _function GetOutput(usedNAR)
**GetOutput**: The function of GetOutput is to parse the raw output generated by the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system and extract different types of information such as executions, inputs, derivations, answers, selections, and reason.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR: An instance of the NAR system.

**Code Description**:
The GetOutput function takes an instance of the NAR system as input and retrieves the raw output generated by the system. It then parses the output to extract various types of information and returns them in a dictionary.

The function first calls the GetRawOutput function, passing the usedNAR instance as an argument. The GetRawOutput function communicates with the NAR system to retrieve the raw output and returns it as a list of strings. The function also returns a boolean value, requestOutputArgs, indicating whether the output contains arguments for the requested operation.

The function then proceeds to parse the raw output to extract different types of information. It initializes several empty lists, including lines, requestOutputArgs, executions, inputs, derivations, answers, and selections. 

The function iterates over each line in the raw output and performs specific parsing operations based on the line's content. For lines starting with '^', the function calls the parseExecution function to parse the execution information and appends the parsed information to the executions list. For lines starting with 'Input:', the function calls the parseTask function to parse the input information and appends the parsed information to the inputs list. For lines starting with 'Derived:' or 'Revised:', the function calls the parseTask function to parse the derivation information and appends the parsed information to the derivations list. For lines starting with 'Answer:', the function calls the parseTask function to parse the answer information and appends the parsed information to the answers list. For lines starting with 'Selected:', the function calls the parseTask function to parse the selection information and appends the parsed information to the selections list.

The function also calls the parseReason function, passing the entire raw output as a string, to parse the reason information. The parsed reason information is stored in the reason variable.

Finally, the function constructs a dictionary containing all the parsed information, including inputs, derivations, answers, executions, reason, selections, raw (the entire raw output as a string), and requestOutputArgs. The dictionary is then returned as the output of the GetOutput function.

**Note**:
- The GetOutput function relies on the GetRawOutput, parseExecution, parseTask, and parseReason functions to parse the raw output and extract the desired information.
- The function assumes that the raw output follows a specific format where different types of information are marked by specific prefixes (e.g., '^' for executions, 'Input:' for inputs, etc.).
- The function assumes that the parseExecution, parseTask, and parseReason functions are able to correctly parse the respective types of information from the raw output.
- The function assumes that the parseTask and parseReason functions are defined and accessible within the same module as the GetOutput function.

**Output Example**:
If the raw output contains the following lines:
```
^execution1
Input: input1
Derived: derived1
Answer: answer1
Selected: selected1
^execution2
Input: input2
Derived: derived2
Answer: answer2
Selected: selected2
```
The GetOutput function will return the following dictionary:
```
{
  "input": ["input1", "input2"],
  "derivations": ["derived1", "derived2"],
  "answers": ["answer1", "answer2"],
  "executions": ["execution1", "execution2"],
  "reason": {"reason_info": "reason_info_value"},
  "selections": ["selected1", "selected2"],
  "raw": "^execution1\nInput: input1\nDerived: derived1\nAnswer: answer1\nSelected: selected1\n^execution2\nInput: input2\nDerived: derived2\nAnswer: answer2\nSelected: selected2\n",
  "requestOutputArgs": True
}
```
## _function GetStats(usedNAR)
**GetStats**: The function of GetStats is to extract statistical information from the raw output generated by the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR: An instance of the NAR system.

**Code Description**:
The GetStats function takes an instance of the NAR system as input and retrieves the raw output using the GetRawOutput function. It then parses the raw output to extract statistical information and stores it in a dictionary named "Stats".

The function starts by initializing an empty dictionary named "Stats" to store the extracted statistical information. It calls the GetRawOutput function and assigns the returned value to two variables: "lines" and an underscore variable.

The function enters a for loop that iterates over each line in the "lines" list. It checks if the line contains a colon ":" using the "in" operator. If the condition is true, it splits the line at the colon ":" using the split() method and assigns the left side of the split to a variable named "leftside". It replaces any spaces in the "leftside" string with underscores "_" using the replace() method and removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip() method. It also splits the right side of the split at the colon ":" using the split() method and assigns the stripped value to a variable named "rightside". The "rightside" value is then converted to a float using the float() function.

The function adds an entry to the "Stats" dictionary with the "leftside" as the key and the "rightside" as the value.

Finally, the function returns the "Stats" dictionary containing the extracted statistical information.

**Note**: 
- The GetStats function assumes that the NAR system is already running and its standard input and output streams are accessible.
- The function relies on the GetRawOutput function to retrieve the raw output from the NAR system.
- The function expects the raw output to be in a specific format where statistical information is represented as key-value pairs separated by a colon ":".
- The function converts the extracted statistical values to floats for numerical calculations or comparisons.

**Output Example**:
```python
Stats = {
    "Execution_Time": 0.123,
    "Inference_Steps": 10,
    "Memory_Usage": 123.45
}
```
## _function AddInput(narsese, Print, usedNAR)
**AddInput**: The function of AddInput is to send a Narsese input to the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system and process the output.

**parameters**:
- narsese: A string representing the Narsese input to be added.
- Print (optional): A boolean value indicating whether to print the raw output. Default is True.
- usedNAR (optional): An instance of the NAR system. Default is NARproc.

**Code Description**:
The AddInput function takes a Narsese input as a string and sends it to the NAR system for processing. It communicates with the NAR system through its standard input and output streams.

The function starts by writing the Narsese input followed by a newline character to the standard input of the NAR system using the stdin.write() method. It then flushes the standard input to ensure the input is sent immediately using the stdin.flush() method.

The function checks if the Narsese input is equal to "*stats" to determine if the user wants to retrieve statistical information from the NAR system. If this condition is true, the function calls the GetStats function to retrieve the statistical information and returns it. If the Print parameter is True, the function also prints the raw output using the print() function.

If the Narsese input is not equal to "*stats", the function calls the GetOutput function to retrieve the parsed output from the NAR system. The parsed output contains different types of information such as executions, inputs, derivations, answers, selections, and reason. If the Print parameter is True, the function prints the "raw" key of the parsed output, which represents the entire raw output as a string. The sys.stdout.flush() function is used to ensure the printed output is immediately visible.

Finally, the function returns the parsed output, which includes the inputs, derivations, answers, executions, reason, selections, raw (the entire raw output as a string), and requestOutputArgs (a boolean value indicating whether the output contains arguments for the requested operation).

**Note**:
- The AddInput function assumes that the NAR system is already running and its standard input and output streams are accessible.
- The function relies on the GetStats and GetOutput functions to retrieve the statistical and parsed output from the NAR system, respectively.
- The function allows the user to specify whether to print the raw output and which NAR instance to use through the Print and usedNAR parameters, respectively.
- The function assumes that the GetStats and GetOutput functions are defined and accessible within the same module as the AddInput function.

**Output Example**:
If the Narsese input is "*stats" and the Print parameter is True, the function will print the following raw output:
```
Execution_Time: 0.123
Inference_Steps: 10
Memory_Usage: 123.45
```
The function will also return the following parsed output:
```python
{
  "input": [],
  "derivations": [],
  "answers": [],
  "executions": [],
  "reason": {},
  "selections": [],
  "raw": "Execution_Time: 0.123\nInference_Steps: 10\nMemory_Usage: 123.45\n",
  "requestOutputArgs": False
}
```
## _function Exit(usedNAR)
**Exit**: The function of Exit is to send a "quit" command to the usedNAR process.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR: This parameter is optional and represents the NAR process to which the "quit" command will be sent. If not provided, the default value is NARproc.

**Code Description**:
The Exit function is a simple function that sends a "quit" command to the usedNAR process. It takes an optional parameter, usedNAR, which represents the NAR process to which the command will be sent. If the usedNAR parameter is not provided, the function uses the default value NARproc.

The function uses the sendline method of the usedNAR process to send the "quit" command. The sendline method sends a line of text to the process, followed by a newline character. In this case, the "quit" command is sent as a line of text to the usedNAR process.

The purpose of sending the "quit" command is to terminate the NAR process. This can be useful when the NAR process is no longer needed and should be stopped.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the usedNAR process is running and accessible before calling the Exit function. Otherwise, an error may occur.
- If the usedNAR parameter is not provided, the function will use the default value NARproc. Make sure that NARproc is a valid NAR process before calling the Exit function.
## _function Reset(usedNAR)
**Reset**: The function of Reset is to reset the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system by adding a "*reset" Narsese input.

**parameters**:
- usedNAR (optional): An instance of the NAR system. Default is NARproc.

**Code Description**:
The Reset function is a simple wrapper function that calls the AddInput function with the "*reset" Narsese input. The AddInput function is responsible for sending the Narsese input to the NAR system and processing the output.

The Reset function takes an optional parameter usedNAR, which represents an instance of the NAR system. If no instance is provided, the default instance NARproc is used.

When called, the Reset function passes the "*reset" Narsese input to the AddInput function along with the usedNAR parameter. The AddInput function then sends the Narsese input to the NAR system for processing.

**Note**:
- The Reset function assumes that the NAR system is already running and its standard input and output streams are accessible.
- The function relies on the AddInput function to send the Narsese input to the NAR system and process the output.
- The function allows the user to specify which NAR instance to use through the usedNAR parameter. If no instance is provided, the default instance NARproc is used.
- The function assumes that the AddInput function is defined and accessible within the same module as the Reset function.
## _function PrintedTask(task)
**PrintedTask**: The function of PrintedTask is to generate a string representation of a task based on the provided task object.

**Parameters**:
- task: A dictionary object representing a task. It should have the following keys:
  - "term": A string representing the term of the task.
  - "punctuation": A string representing the punctuation of the task.
  - "occurrenceTime": A string representing the occurrence time of the task.
  - "Priority" (optional): An integer representing the priority of the task.
  - "truth" (optional): A dictionary object representing the truth value of the task. It should have the following keys:
    - "frequency": A string representing the frequency of the truth value.
    - "confidence": A string representing the confidence of the truth value.

**Code Description**:
The PrintedTask function takes a task object as input and generates a string representation of the task. It first initializes the string variable "st" with the concatenation of the "term" and "punctuation" values from the task object.

Next, it checks if the "occurrenceTime" value is a digit. If it is, it appends the string " :|: occurrenceTime=" followed by the "occurrenceTime" value to the "st" variable.

Then, it checks if the "Priority" key is present in the task object. If it is, it appends the string " Priority=" followed by the value of the "Priority" key converted to a string.

Finally, it checks if the "truth" key is present in the task object. If it is, it appends the string " Truth: frequency=" followed by the "frequency" value from the "truth" dictionary, and then appends the string " confidence=" followed by the "confidence" value from the "truth" dictionary.

The function then returns the generated string representation of the task.

**Note**: 
- The "occurrenceTime" value is only included in the generated string if it is a digit.
- The "Priority" value is only included in the generated string if the "Priority" key is present in the task object.
- The "truth" value is only included in the generated string if the "truth" key is present in the task object.

**Output Example**:
If the task object is:
```python
task = {
    "term": "Buy groceries",
    "punctuation": ".",
    "occurrenceTime": "123456",
    "Priority": 3,
    "truth": {
        "frequency": "high",
        "confidence": "0.8"
    }
}
```
The output of PrintedTask(task) would be:
```
"Buy groceries. :|: occurrenceTime=123456 Priority=3 Truth: frequency=high confidence=0.8"
```
## _function Shell
**Shell**: The function of Shell is to create a shell-like interface that continuously prompts the user for input, sends the input to the NAR (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning) system for processing, and calls the AddInput function to handle the input.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The Shell function creates an infinite loop using the while True statement. Within the loop, it prompts the user for input using the input() function and stores the input in the variable 'inp'. The rstrip("\n") method is used to remove any trailing newline characters from the input.

The function then attempts to execute the following code block using the try-except statement. If an exception occurs, the exit(0) function is called to terminate the program.

Inside the try block, the function calls the AddInput function and passes the user input as an argument. This function is responsible for sending the Narsese input to the NAR system for processing.

**Note**:
- The Shell function assumes that the NAR system is already running and accessible.
- The function relies on the AddInput function to handle the user input and communicate with the NAR system.
- The function creates an infinite loop, so it will continue prompting the user for input until the program is terminated externally.

**Relationship with other objects**:
- The Shell function calls the AddInput function to handle the user input and communicate with the NAR system. The AddInput function is defined in the NAR.py module.

**Note**:
- The AddInput function is responsible for sending the Narsese input to the NAR system and processing the output.
- The Shell function creates a shell-like interface that continuously prompts the user for input and calls the AddInput function to handle the input.
