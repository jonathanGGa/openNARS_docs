## _function encode(st)
**encode**: The function of encode is to encode a string into bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.

**parameters**:
- st: A string that needs to be encoded.

**Code Description**:
The `encode` function takes a string `st` as input and encodes it into bytes using the UTF-8 encoding. The function first checks the value of the `version` variable. If `version` is equal to 2, the function returns the input string `st` as it is. Otherwise, it encodes the string `st` using the UTF-8 encoding and returns the encoded bytes.

The purpose of encoding the string is to ensure that it can be transmitted or stored correctly, especially when dealing with different character encodings or network protocols that require specific encoding formats.

In the given code snippet, the `encode` function is called within the `receive_thread` function. The `receive_thread` function is responsible for receiving messages and sending them over an IRC connection. When sending a message, the `encode` function is used to encode the message string before sending it.

**Note**:
- The `version` variable is not defined within the `encode` function. It is assumed that the `version` variable is defined and accessible from the calling context.
- The `encode` function assumes that the default encoding is UTF-8. If a different encoding is required, the code can be modified accordingly.

**Output Example**:
If the input string `st` is "Hello, World!", the `encode` function will return the encoded bytes: b'Hello, World!'.
## _function decode(st)
**decode**: The function of decode is to convert a string from bytes to Unicode.

**parameters**:
- st: The string to be decoded.

**Code Description**:
The `decode` function takes a string `st` as input and checks the value of the `version` variable. If the `version` is equal to 2, the function returns the input string `st` as it is. Otherwise, if the `version` is not equal to 2, the function decodes the input string `st` using the "utf-8" encoding and returns the decoded string.

The purpose of this function is to handle the decoding of strings based on the value of the `version` variable. If the `version` is 2, it assumes that the string is already in Unicode format and returns it as is. If the `version` is not 2, it assumes that the string is in bytes format and needs to be decoded using the "utf-8" encoding to convert it to Unicode.

**Note**:
- The `version` variable is not defined within the scope of the `decode` function. It should be defined and assigned a value before calling the `decode` function.
- The `decode` function assumes that the input string `st` is encoded using the "utf-8" encoding. If the input string is encoded using a different encoding, the function may not produce the expected result.

**Output Example**:
If the `version` is 2:
```
decode("Hello") => "Hello"
```
If the `version` is not 2:
```
decode(b"Hello") => "Hello"
```
## _function receive_thread(a)
**receive_thread**: The function of receive_thread is to continuously receive user input messages and send them over an IRC connection.

**parameters**:
- a: This parameter is not used in the function and can be ignored.

**Code Description**:
The `receive_thread` function is a loop that continuously receives user input messages using the `input()` function. The received message is then stripped of any trailing newline characters using the `rstrip("\n")` method. 

Next, the function checks if the received message is not equal to `None` and not an empty string. If the condition is true, the function calls the `encode` function to encode the message string using the UTF-8 encoding. The encoded message is then sent over the IRC connection using the `irc.send()` function.

The purpose of the `receive_thread` function is to provide a continuous input mechanism for users to send messages over an IRC connection. By running this function in a separate thread, it allows for simultaneous sending and receiving of messages.

**Note**:
- The `irc` object used in the `receive_thread` function is not defined within the code snippet provided. It is assumed that the `irc` object is defined and accessible from the calling context.
- The `encode` function is called within the `receive_thread` function to encode the message string before sending it over the IRC connection. The `encode` function is assumed to be defined and accessible from the calling context.
- The `receive_thread` function does not have any error handling or termination conditions. It will continue running indefinitely until manually stopped or interrupted.

**Output Example**:
If the user enters the message "Hello, World!" when prompted, the `receive_thread` function will encode the message using the `encode` function and send it over the IRC connection.
