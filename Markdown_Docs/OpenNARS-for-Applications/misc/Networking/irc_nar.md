## _function encode(st)
**encode**: The function of encode is to encode a given string into UTF-8 format.

**parameters**:
- st: A string that needs to be encoded.

**Code Description**:
The `encode` function takes a string `st` as input and encodes it into UTF-8 format. The function first checks the value of the variable `version`. If `version` is equal to 2, the function simply returns the input string `st` as it is. Otherwise, if `version` is not equal to 2, the function encodes the string `st` using the `encode` method with the parameter "utf-8". The encoded string is then returned as the output.

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the string is encoded in UTF-8 format, which is a widely used character encoding for Unicode.

This function is called by the `receive_thread` function in the `irc_nar.py` file. In the `receive_thread` function, the `encode` function is used to encode the message before sending it over the IRC connection. This ensures that the message is properly encoded and can be correctly interpreted by the recipient.

**Note**:
- The `version` variable is not defined within the `encode` function. It should be defined and assigned a value before calling the `encode` function to ensure proper functionality.
- The `encode` function assumes that the default encoding is UTF-8. If a different encoding is desired, the encoding parameter in the `encode` method can be modified accordingly.

**Output Example**:
If the input string `st` is "Hello, world!", the output of the `encode` function would be the UTF-8 encoded representation of the string.
## _function decode(st)
**decode**: The function of decode is to convert a string from bytes to Unicode.

**parameters**:
- st: The string to be decoded.

**Code Description**:
The `decode` function takes a string `st` as input and converts it from bytes to Unicode. It first checks the value of the `version` variable. If `version` is equal to 2, the function returns the input string `st` as it is, assuming it is already in Unicode format. Otherwise, if `version` is not equal to 2, the function uses the `decode` method with the "utf-8" encoding to convert the string `st` from bytes to Unicode.

**Note**:
- The `version` variable is not defined in the given code snippet. It is assumed that it is defined elsewhere in the code.
- The "utf-8" encoding is used for decoding the string. If the string `st` is not encoded using the "utf-8" encoding, the decoding process may result in an error.

**Output Example**:
If `version` is equal to 2:
```
decode("Hello") -> "Hello"
```
If `version` is not equal to 2:
```
decode(b"Hello") -> "Hello"
```
## _function receive_thread(a)
**receive_thread**: The function of receive_thread is to continuously receive messages from a process and send them over an IRC connection.

**parameters**:
- a: The process from which messages are received.

**Code Description**:
The `receive_thread` function is a loop that runs indefinitely. Within the loop, it reads a line of output from the `proc` process and assigns it to the variable `msg`. 

Next, the function checks if `msg` is not empty and if it contains any of the elements in the `Narsese_Filter` list. If both conditions are true, it prints the message with the prefix "NAR output: ".

Finally, the function sends the encoded message over the IRC connection using the `irc.send` function. The message is encoded using the `encode` function, which ensures that the message is properly encoded in UTF-8 format.

The purpose of the `receive_thread` function is to continuously receive messages from the `proc` process and send them over the IRC connection. It filters the received messages based on the `Narsese_Filter` list and only sends the messages that match the filter.

This function is called within the `irc_nar.py` file and is typically used as a separate thread to continuously receive and send messages in the background.

**Note**:
- The `proc` process should be defined and passed as an argument to the `receive_thread` function before calling it.
- The `Narsese_Filter` list should be defined and populated with the desired filter elements before calling the `receive_thread` function.
- The `irc.send` function should be properly configured and connected to the IRC server before calling the `receive_thread` function.
- The `encode` function is used to encode the message before sending it over the IRC connection. Ensure that the `encode` function is properly defined and imported before calling the `receive_thread` function.
- The `encode` function assumes that the default encoding is UTF-8. If a different encoding is desired, the encoding parameter in the `encode` method can be modified accordingly.
