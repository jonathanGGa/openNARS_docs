## _function encode(st)
**encode**: The function of encode is to convert a string to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.

**parameters**:
- st: The string to be encoded.

**Code Description**:
The `encode` function takes a string `st` as input and checks the value of the `version` variable. If the `version` is equal to 2, the function returns the input string as it is. Otherwise, it encodes the string using the UTF-8 encoding and returns the encoded bytes.

The function first checks if the `version` variable is equal to 2. If it is, it means that the encoding should not be performed and the function simply returns the input string `st`. This is useful when the code is running in a Python 2 environment where strings are already represented as bytes.

If the `version` variable is not equal to 2, it means that the code is running in a Python 3 environment where strings are represented as Unicode objects. In this case, the function uses the `encode` method of the string object to encode the string using the UTF-8 encoding. The UTF-8 encoding is a widely used encoding that can represent any Unicode character using variable-length sequences of bytes. The `encode` method returns the encoded bytes.

**Note**:
- The `version` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided. It is assumed that the variable is defined elsewhere in the code and its value determines whether the encoding should be performed or not.
- The `encode` function assumes that the input string `st` is already in a Unicode format. If the input string is not in a Unicode format, it may raise a `UnicodeEncodeError`.

**Output Example**:
If the `version` variable is equal to 2:
```
encode("Hello World") => "Hello World"
```

If the `version` variable is not equal to 2:
```
encode("Hello World") => b"Hello World"
```
## _function decode(st)
**decode**: The function of decode is to convert a string from bytes to Unicode.

**parameters**:
- st: The string to be decoded.

**Code Description**:
The `decode` function takes a string `st` as input and checks the value of the `version` variable. If the `version` is equal to 2, the function returns the input string as it is. Otherwise, it decodes the input string using the "utf-8" encoding and returns the decoded Unicode string.

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the input string is in Unicode format, which is the standard format for text in Python 3. In Python 2, strings were represented as bytes by default, but in Python 3, strings are represented as Unicode characters. Therefore, when working with strings that are encoded in a different format, such as UTF-8, it is necessary to decode them into Unicode before performing any operations on them.

The `decode` function uses the `decode` method of the string object to perform the decoding. The `decode` method takes an encoding as an argument and returns the decoded string. In this case, the encoding used is "utf-8", which is a widely used encoding for Unicode characters.

**Note**:
- It is important to ensure that the `version` variable is correctly set before calling the `decode` function. If the `version` is not set correctly, the function may not behave as expected.
- The `decode` function assumes that the input string is encoded in UTF-8. If the input string is encoded in a different format, the function may not be able to decode it correctly.

**Output Example**:
If the input string is "Hello, World!", the `decode` function will return the same string "Hello, World!" if the `version` is set to 2. If the `version` is not 2, the function will decode the string using UTF-8 and return the Unicode representation of the string.
