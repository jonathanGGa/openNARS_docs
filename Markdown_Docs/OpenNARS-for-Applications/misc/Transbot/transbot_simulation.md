## _function detect_objects
**detect_objects**: The function of detect_objects is to detect objects in a simulated environment.

**parameters**:
- No parameters.

**Code Description**:
The detect_objects function is responsible for detecting objects in a simulated environment. It first checks the value of the global variable "going". If "going" is True, it sets "going" to False and returns a list containing a tuple representing a person object. The tuple consists of the following elements: object type ("person"), x-coordinate (0), y-coordinate (480), width (10), height (10), confidence score (0.9), and color (black). Additionally, an empty string is returned as the second element of the list.

If "going" is False, the function checks if the variable "picked" is True. If "picked" is True, it sets the object type to "bottle". If "picked" is False, it randomly selects an object type from the list ["table", "person"] using the random.choice() function. The function also randomly selects a y-coordinate from the list [0, 375, 375]. The remaining elements of the tuple representing the object are the same as in the previous case. Finally, the function returns a list containing the tuple representing the object and an empty string.

**Note**:
- The global variable "going" is assumed to be defined and accessible from within the function.
- The variable "picked" is assumed to be defined and accessible from within the function.
- The random.choice() function is assumed to be imported and available for use.

**Output Example**:
- If "going" is True:
    - Output: ([("person", 0, 480, 10, 10, 0.9, (0,0,0))], "")
- If "going" is False and "picked" is True:
    - Output: ([("bottle", random_y_coordinate, 480, 10, 10, 0.9, (0,0,0))], "")
- If "going" is False and "picked" is False:
    - Output: ([("table" or "person", random_y_coordinate, 480, 10, 10, 0.9, (0,0,0))], "")
## _function getLocation
**getLocation**: The function of getLocation is to retrieve the current location of the Transbot.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `getLocation` function is a simple function that returns the current location of the Transbot. The function does not require any input parameters. It directly returns a list containing two tuples. The first tuple represents the position of the Transbot in a three-dimensional coordinate system, while the second tuple represents the orientation of the Transbot in a four-dimensional coordinate system.

The position tuple contains three values: `(x, y, z)`, where `x` represents the Transbot's position along the x-axis, `y` represents the position along the y-axis, and `z` represents the position along the z-axis.

The orientation tuple contains four values: `(w, x, y, z)`, where `w` represents the scalar component of the quaternion representing the Transbot's orientation, and `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the vector components of the quaternion.

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the Transbot's location is already known and can be retrieved.
- The position and orientation values are represented using tuples for convenience and to maintain the integrity of the returned data structure.

**Output Example**:
A possible example of the return value of the `getLocation` function is:
```
[(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0)]
```
This indicates that the Transbot is currently located at the position `(0, 0, 0)` and has an orientation represented by the quaternion `(0, 0, 0, 0)`.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `getCollision` function is a simple function that determines the collision status of a transbot. It uses a random number generator to generate a random value between 0 and 1. If the generated value is greater than 0.3, the function returns "free", indicating that there is no collision. Otherwise, the function randomly selects one of the values from the list ["front", "left", "right"] and returns it, indicating the direction of the collision.

**Note**:
- This function does not require any parameters.
- The collision status is determined randomly based on the generated value. The probability of returning "free" is 70%, while the probability of returning one of the collision directions ("front", "left", "right") is 30%.
- The function uses the `random` module to generate random values.

**Output Example**:
- Example 1:
  - Output: "free"
  - Explanation: The generated random value is 0.8, which is greater than 0.3. Therefore, the function returns "free" to indicate that there is no collision.

- Example 2:
  - Output: "left"
  - Explanation: The generated random value is 0.2, which is less than or equal to 0.3. Therefore, the function randomly selects "left" from the list ["front", "left", "right"] and returns it to indicate a collision on the left side.
