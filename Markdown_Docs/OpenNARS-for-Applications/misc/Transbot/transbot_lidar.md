## _function registerScan(scan_data)
**registerScan**: The function of registerScan is to record the laser scan data and publish the position of the nearest object or point.

**parameters**:
- scan_data: The input parameter representing the laser scan data.

**Code Description**:
The registerScan function begins by initializing the global variables Left_warning, Right_warning, and front_warning to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the number of warnings detected in different directions.

The function then converts the scan_data.ranges into a numpy array called "ranges". This array represents the distances measured by the laser scanner.

Next, the function sorts the indices of the "ranges" array in ascending order using np.argsort(). This allows the function to process the points from closer to farther distances.

The function then enters a loop that iterates over the sorted indices. Within this loop, the function checks the length of the scan_data.ranges array to determine if it is a 720-point scan or a 360-point scan.

For a 720-point scan, the function checks if the index falls within the range of 20 to LaserAngle * 2 (where LaserAngle is a predefined constant). If the distance at that index is less than the ResponseDist (another predefined constant), the Left_warning counter is incremented.

Similarly, for indices falling within the range of (720 - LaserAngle * 2) to 700, the function checks if the distance is less than ResponseDist and increments the Right_warning counter.

For indices falling outside these two ranges (i.e., (700 <= i) or (i <= 20)), the function checks if the distance is less than or equal to ResponseDist and increments the front_warning counter.

For a 360-point scan, the function follows a similar logic but with different index ranges.

**Note**: It is important to note that this function assumes the input scan_data.ranges array is either 720-point or 360-point. The function also relies on the predefined constants LaserAngle and ResponseDist to determine the ranges and thresholds for warning detection.
## _function getCollision
**getCollision**: The function of getCollision is to determine the collision status of the Transbot based on the lidar sensor readings.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**:
The getCollision function is responsible for determining the collision status of the Transbot based on the readings from the lidar sensor. The function first prints the lidar readings for front, left, and right directions. It then compares these readings to a threshold value of 10 to determine if a collision is imminent.

If the front_warning reading is greater than 10 and is also greater than both the Left_warning and Right_warning readings, the function returns "front" to indicate that a collision is likely to occur in the front direction.

If the Left_warning reading is greater than 10 and is also greater than both the front_warning and Right_warning readings, the function returns "left" to indicate that a collision is likely to occur in the left direction.

If the Right_warning reading is greater than 10 and is also greater than both the front_warning and Left_warning readings, the function returns "right" to indicate that a collision is likely to occur in the right direction.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns "free" to indicate that there is no immediate collision threat.

**Note**:
- The lidar readings for front_warning, Left_warning, and Right_warning should be provided before calling this function.
- The threshold value for determining a collision can be adjusted by modifying the value of 10 in the code.

**Output Example**:
If the lidar readings are as follows:
- front_warning = 15
- Left_warning = 5
- Right_warning = 8

The function will return "front" as the collision status.
