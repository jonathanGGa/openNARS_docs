## _function rgbtopic(msg)
**rgbtopic**: The function of rgbtopic is to process the RGB image data received as a message and update the global frame variable with the decoded and resized image.

**parameters**:
- msg: The message containing the RGB image data.

**Code Description**:
The rgbtopic function first checks if the received message is an instance of the CompressedImage class. If it is not, the function returns without performing any further processing.

Next, the function acquires the framelock, which is a global lock used to ensure thread safety when accessing the frame variable.

The function then converts the image data in the message to a NumPy array using the np.fromstring() function. The data is interpreted as unsigned 8-bit integers (np.uint8).

The NumPy array is then decoded using the cv.imdecode() function from the OpenCV library. The decoding process converts the compressed image data into a BGR image.

After decoding, the image is resized using the cv.resize() function. The desired width and height for the resized image are specified using the transbot_vision_WIDTH and transbot_vision_HEIGHT variables.

Finally, the framelock is released to allow other threads to access the frame variable.

**Note**:
- This function expects the received message to be of type CompressedImage. If the message is not of this type, the function will return without performing any further processing.
- The global variables frame and framelock are assumed to be defined and accessible within the scope of this function.

**Output Example**:
The updated frame variable will contain the decoded and resized RGB image data.
## _function cropImage(img, BB)
**cropImage**: The function of cropImage is to crop an image based on the given bounding box.

**Parameters**:
- img: The input image to be cropped.
- BB: The bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height) specifying the region to be cropped.

**Code Description**:
The cropImage function takes an image and a bounding box as input. The bounding box is represented by a tuple (x, y, w, h), where (x, y) is the top-left corner of the box, and w and h are the width and height of the box, respectively.

The function then uses the bounding box coordinates to extract the region of interest from the input image. This is done by slicing the image array using the y:y+h and x:x+w indices, which selects the rows and columns within the specified range.

Finally, the cropped image is returned as the output of the function.

The cropImage function is called by the applyYOLO function in the transbot_vision.py file. In the applyYOLO function, the cropImage function is used to crop the image based on the bounding box coordinates of detected objects. The cropped image is then further processed to extract dominant colors and perform other operations.

**Note**:
- The cropImage function assumes that the input image and bounding box coordinates are valid and within the image dimensions.
- The function does not perform any error handling or validation for the input parameters.

**Output Example**:
A cropped image based on the provided bounding box coordinates.
## _function dominantColorsWithPixelCounts(img)
**dominantColorsWithPixelCounts**: The function of dominantColorsWithPixelCounts is to calculate the dominant colors in an image along with their corresponding pixel counts.

**parameters**:
- img: The input image for which the dominant colors need to be calculated.

**Code Description**:
The function first converts the input image from the BGR color space to the RGB color space using the cvtColor function from the OpenCV library. This is done because the kmeans function, which is used later, requires the input to be in the RGB color space.

Next, the function reshapes the image into a 2D array of pixels using the reshape function. Each pixel is represented as a 3-element array containing the RGB values.

The function then specifies the number of color clusters to be used for the k-means clustering algorithm. In this case, the value is set to 5.

The kmeans function is then called with the input pixels, number of color clusters, and other parameters. This function performs k-means clustering on the input pixels and returns the cluster labels and the cluster centers (palette).

Using the cluster labels, the function calculates the counts of each cluster using the unique function from the numpy library.

The function then combines the palette and counts into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a color from the palette and its corresponding count.

Optionally, the list of tuples can be sorted in descending order based on the counts using the sort function and a lambda function as the key.

Finally, the function returns the list of tuples representing the dominant colors with their pixel counts.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes that the input image is in the BGR color space. If the input image is already in the RGB color space, the conversion step can be skipped.
- The number of color clusters used for k-means clustering can be adjusted based on the desired level of color detail.
- The sorting step using the sort function is not necessary if the order of the dominant colors is not important.

**Output Example**:
[(255, 0, 0), 1000], [(0, 255, 0), 800], [(0, 0, 255), 600], [(255, 255, 0), 400], [(0, 255, 255), 200]
## _function applyYOLO(img)
**applyYOLO**: The function of applyYOLO is to apply the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to an input image and return the image with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects, as well as a list of detections.

**Parameters**:
- img: The input image on which the YOLO algorithm will be applied.

**Code Description**:
The applyYOLO function first sets a detection confidence threshold to 0.3. This threshold determines the minimum confidence level required for an object detection to be considered valid.

Next, the function calls the detect function from the yolo object, passing in the input image and the detection confidence threshold. The detect function returns three arrays: boxes, confs, and clss. These arrays contain the bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class labels for the detected objects, respectively.

The function then initializes an empty list called detections. It iterates over the class labels array and performs the following operations for each detected object:

- Retrieves the class ID, bounding box coordinates, and class name from the corresponding arrays.
- Checks if the warn_person_car flag is enabled and if the class name is either "person" or "car". If both conditions are met, it calculates the y-coordinate of the bottom of the bounding box and compares it to the warn_distance threshold. If the y-coordinate is greater than or equal to the threshold, it sets the bot to beep with a frequency of 1000 Hz.
- Calls the cropImage function, passing in the input image and the bounding box coordinates. This function crops the image based on the specified bounding box.
- Calls the dominantColorsWithPixelCounts function, passing in the cropped image. This function calculates the dominant colors in the cropped image along with their corresponding pixel counts.
- Appends a list containing the class name, bounding box coordinates, confidence score, and dominant color to the detections list.
- Draws a rectangle around the detected object on the input image using the bounding box coordinates and a color based on the class ID.
- Writes the class name and the top-left coordinates of the bounding box as text on the input image.

After processing all the detected objects, the detections list is sorted in descending order based on the sum of the y-coordinate and height of the bounding box. This sorting is done to prioritize objects that are closer to the camera.

Finally, the function returns the input image with the bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects and the detections list.

**Note**:
- The applyYOLO function assumes that the yolo object, COCO_CLASSES_LIST, warn_person_car flag, warn_distance threshold, bot object, COLORS array, cv module, cropImage function, and dominantColorsWithPixelCounts function are all defined and accessible within the scope of the function.
- The function does not handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of the code.
- The output image and detections list may vary depending on the input image and the performance of the YOLO object detection algorithm.

**Output Example**:
A modified input image with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects and a list of detections:
```
img: modified input image
detections: [
    ["person", x1, y1, width1, height1, confidence1, (r1, g1, b1)],
    ["car", x2, y2, width2, height2, confidence2, (r2, g2, b2)],
    ...
]
```
## _function detect_objects
**detect_objects**: The function of detect_objects is to detect objects in a given frame using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. It returns a list of detections and the modified frame with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects.

**Parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The detect_objects function begins by acquiring a lock on the global frame variable to ensure thread safety. It then creates a copy of the frame and releases the lock. 

Next, the function checks if the frame is not empty. If it is not empty, it proceeds to apply the YOLO algorithm to the frame by calling the applyYOLO function. This function takes the frame copy as input and returns the modified frame with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects, as well as a list of detections.

The function calculates the frames per second (FPS) by measuring the time taken to apply the YOLO algorithm. It then adds the FPS value as text to the modified frame using the cv.putText function.

The modified frame is displayed using the cv.imshow function. Finally, the function returns the list of detections and the modified frame.

**Note**:
- The applyYOLO function is called within the detect_objects function, so it must be defined and accessible within the scope of the function.
- The global variables frame and framelock are used to store and access the current frame.
- The code includes commented out sections related to depth frame processing, which are currently not used.
- The cv module is used for image processing and display.
- The returned detections list contains information about the detected objects, including the class name, bounding box coordinates, confidence score, and dominant color.
- The modified frame is displayed with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects and the FPS value as text.

**Output Example**:
A modified frame with bounding boxes drawn around the detected objects and a list of detections:
```
detections: [
    ["person", x1, y1, width1, height1, confidence1, (r1, g1, b1)],
    ["car", x2, y2, width2, height2, confidence2, (r2, g2, b2)],
    ...
]
frame: modified frame
```
