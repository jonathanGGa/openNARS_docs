## _function ctests(Example, Args, DoneAfterMetric)
**ctests**: The function of ctests is to execute a command-line test and retrieve the test results.

**parameters**:
- Example: A string representing the example being tested.
- Args: A string containing the command-line arguments for the test.
- DoneAfterMetric: A boolean value indicating whether the function should stop after retrieving the test metric.

**Code Description**:
The ctests function takes three parameters: Example, Args, and DoneAfterMetric. It executes a command-line test by running the specified command with the given arguments. The test results are captured and processed to extract the relevant information.

First, the function uses the run function from the subprocess module to execute the command specified in Args. The stdout and stderr outputs of the command are captured and stored in the result variable. The universal_newlines parameter is set to True to ensure that the captured outputs are returned as strings.

Next, the function checks the returncode of the executed command. If the returncode is not 0, indicating an error, the function prints the captured stdout and stderr outputs and exits with the same returncode.

If the returncode is 0, the function iterates over the lines of the captured stdout output in reverse order. It searches for a line that contains the substring "ratio=". This line typically contains the test metric information.

If DoneAfterMetric is True, the function prints the example name followed by the found metric line and returns, indicating that the test is done.

If DoneAfterMetric is False, the function simply prints the found metric line.

If no metric line is found, the function prints a message indicating that the test was successful.

**Note**:
- The Args parameter should be a string containing the command-line arguments for the test. The arguments should be separated by spaces.
- The Example parameter is used to provide context for the test. It is printed along with the metric line if DoneAfterMetric is True.
- The function relies on the run function from the subprocess module to execute the command. Make sure the necessary dependencies are installed.

**Output Example**:
Example successful!
## _function Test(Example, outputString)
**Test**: The function of Test is to evaluate the performance of a test case by analyzing the output string and comparing it with the expected conditions.

**parameters**:
- Example: A string representing the name of the test case.
- outputString: A string containing the output generated by the test case.

**Code Description**:
The Test function begins by initializing several variables to keep track of timing, confidence, and question statistics. It then splits the outputString into individual lines and sets a flag called AnswerRatioTest to True.

Next, the function iterates over each line in the outputString. For lines that start with the "Comment: expected" condition, the function increments the QuestionsTotal counter and the global QuestionsTotalGlobal counter. It then checks if the line is an answer condition or an execution condition.

If the line is an answer condition, the function extracts the expected output and confidence from the line. It then searches for the corresponding answer in the previous lines of the outputString. If a matching answer is found, the function increments the QuestionsAnswered counter and the global QuestionsAnsweredGlobal counter. It also calculates the maximum confidence obtained and the creation time of that answer. If the AnswerRatioTest flag is False, the function compares the obtained confidence with the expected confidence. If the obtained confidence is lower than the expected confidence, the function prints a failure message and exits.

If the line is an execution condition, the function extracts the message from the line and searches for a matching execution in the previous lines of the outputString. If a matching execution is found, the function increments the QuestionsAnswered counter and the global QuestionsAnsweredGlobal counter. If no matching execution is found, the function prints a failure message and exits.

After processing all the lines in the outputString, the function checks the AnswerRatioTest flag. If it is True, the function prints the Q&A stress test results, including the total number of questions, the number of correctly answered questions, and the answer ratio. If it is False, the function prints the Q&A metrics, including the average answer time, the average answer confidence, and the combined loss.

Finally, the function updates the global timing and confidence variables with the local values.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to evaluate the performance of a test case by comparing the output with the expected conditions.
- The outputString should contain the output generated by the test case in the expected format.
- The function relies on specific conditions in the outputString to identify answers and executions.
- The function assumes that the outputString contains the relevant information for evaluation.
- It is important to ensure that the expected conditions in the outputString are correctly formatted to avoid incorrect evaluations.
