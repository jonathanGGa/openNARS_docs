## _function narseseToEnglish_noColors
**narseseToEnglish_noColors**: The function of narseseToEnglish_noColors is to initialize global variables for color codes used in the NARSese to English translation process.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**:
The `narseseToEnglish_noColors` function is responsible for initializing global variables that store color codes used in the NARSese to English translation process. These color codes are used to add color to the translated output, but this specific function does not include the color codes. The global variables initialized in this function are `GREEN`, `YELLOW`, `CYAN`, `MAGENTA`, `RED`, `RESET`, and `BOLD`.

The purpose of these global variables is to provide a way to add color to the translated output when needed. However, in this specific implementation, the color codes are not included in the variables. Therefore, the translated output will not have any color applied to it.

**Note**:
- This function does not take any parameters.
- The global variables initialized in this function can be used in other parts of the code to add color to the translated output if desired.
## _function narseseToEnglish(line)
**narseseToEnglish**: The function of narseseToEnglish is to convert Narsese statements into English sentences.

**parameters**:
- line: A string representing a Narsese statement.

**Code Description**:
The `narseseToEnglish` function takes a Narsese statement as input and converts it into an English sentence. It applies a series of string manipulations and regular expressions to transform the Narsese syntax into a more readable English representation.

The function starts by defining a variable `COLOR` and setting it to the value `GREEN`. It then performs several string replacements on the input `line` to replace specific Narsese syntax with their corresponding English equivalents. For example, it replaces "(! " with "not ", "#1" with "it", "$1" with "it", "#2" with "thing", and "$2" with "thing".

Next, the function checks the starting pattern of the `line` to determine the appropriate color for the English sentence. If the `line` starts with "performing " or "done with", the `COLOR` is set to `CYAN`. If it starts with "Comment: expected:", the `COLOR` is set to a combination of `BOLD` and `MAGENTA`. If it starts with "Comment:" or "//", the `COLOR` is set to `MAGENTA`. If it starts with "Input:", the `COLOR` is set to `GREEN`. If it starts with "Derived:" or "Revised:", the `COLOR` is set to `YELLOW`. If it starts with "Answer:", "^", or contains the phrase "decision expectation", the `COLOR` is set to a combination of `BOLD` and `RED`.

After determining the color, the function applies a series of regular expressions to transform specific Narsese syntax into their English counterparts. It replaces sets enclosed in curly braces `{}` and square brackets `[]` with the corresponding English terms, using the colors defined earlier. It also replaces image expressions enclosed in parentheses `()` with the English representation, including the color coding. Additionally, it handles implications, conjunctions, similarity, and inheritance statements, replacing them with their English equivalents.

Finally, the function returns the transformed `line` with the appropriate color coding and formatting applied.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the input `line` is a valid Narsese statement.
- The function uses color codes to highlight different parts of the English sentence for better readability. These color codes are not actual colors but placeholders that can be replaced with the desired formatting in the output.

**Output Example**:
If the input `line` is "(<apple --> fruit>)", the function will return "apple is fruit".
