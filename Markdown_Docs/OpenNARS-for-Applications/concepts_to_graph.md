## _function hasImage(line)
**hasImage**: The function of hasImage is to determine whether a given string contains certain image indicators.

**parameters**:
- line: A string that represents a line of text.

**Code Description**:
The hasImage function takes a string as input and checks if it contains any of the following image indicators: "/1", "/2", "\\1", or "\\2". It returns True if any of these indicators are found in the string, and False otherwise.

This function is used to identify whether a line of text contains image indicators. It is called within the parse_concept function in the OpenNARS-for-Applications\concepts_to_graph.py module. In the parse_concept function, the hasImage function is used to determine if a line of text contains any image indicators before further processing is performed.

**Note**:
- The hasImage function only checks for the presence of specific image indicators and does not perform any image-related operations.
- The function is case-sensitive, so it will only detect the image indicators in the exact specified format.

**Output Example**:
- Input: "This is a test /1"
  Output: True
- Input: "No image indicators here"
  Output: False
## _function parse_concept(line)
**parse_concept**: The function of parse_concept is to extract a concept and its corresponding dictionary from a given line of text.

**parameters**:
- line: A string that represents a line of text.

**Code Description**:
The parse_concept function takes a line of text as input and checks if it starts with the string "//{i=" and does not have any image indicators (if the NoImages flag is False or if the line does not contain any image indicators). If these conditions are met, the function extracts the concept and its corresponding dictionary from the line of text and returns them as a tuple.

To extract the concept, the function splits the line of text by spaces, discards the first element (which is "//{i="), and then splits the remaining elements by ":". The first element of the resulting list is considered as the concept.

To extract the dictionary, the function uses the ast.literal_eval function to evaluate the string representation of the dictionary. The dictionary is extracted from the line of text by splitting it at the first occurrence of ": {" and then adding a "{" at the beginning of the resulting string.

If the line of text does not meet the conditions mentioned above, the function returns (None, None) to indicate that no concept and dictionary were found.

The parse_concept function is called within the OpenNARS-for-Applications\concepts_to_graph.py module. It is used to parse lines of text and extract concepts and dictionaries for further processing.

**Note**:
- The parse_concept function assumes that the line of text follows a specific format, starting with "//{i=" and containing a concept and its corresponding dictionary.
- The function relies on the hasImage function to check for the presence of image indicators in the line of text.
- The function uses the ast.literal_eval function to safely evaluate the string representation of the dictionary.
- The function returns (None, None) if the line of text does not meet the specified conditions or if no concept and dictionary were found.

**Output Example**:
- Input: "//{i=concept_name: {dictionary_key: dictionary_value}}"
  Output: ("concept_name", {"dictionary_key": "dictionary_value"})
- Input: "//{i=invalid_line}"
  Output: (None, None)
## _function parse_truth(line)
**parse_truth**: The function of parse_truth is to extract the truth value from a given line of text.

**parameters**:
- line: A string representing a line of text containing a truth value in the format "TV = {x y}", where x and y are floating-point numbers.

**Code Description**:
The parse_truth function takes a line of text as input and extracts the truth value from it. The truth value is expected to be in the format "TV = {x y}", where x and y are floating-point numbers representing the belief and disbelief values, respectively.

The function first splits the line using the ". {" delimiter to extract the truth value portion. The resulting list will contain two elements: the belief value and the disbelief value, separated by a space. The belief value is located at index 0, and the disbelief value is located at index 1.

The function then converts the belief and disbelief values from strings to floats using the float() function.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the belief and disbelief values.

**Note**:
- This function assumes that the input line is in the correct format. If the line does not contain a truth value in the expected format, the function may raise an IndexError or produce unexpected results.
- It is recommended to validate the input line before calling this function to ensure it contains a valid truth value.

**Output Example**:
If the input line is "TV = {0.8 0.2}", the function will return the tuple (0.8, 0.2).
## _function truth_expectation(truth)
**truth_expectation**: The function of truth_expectation is to calculate the truth expectation value based on the given truth value.

**parameters**:
- truth: A tuple representing the truth value, where the first element (f) represents the frequency and the second element (c) represents the confidence.

**Code Description**:
The `truth_expectation` function takes a truth value as input and calculates the truth expectation value using the following formula:
```
(f,c) = truth
return c * (f - 0.5) + 0.5
```
The function first unpacks the frequency (f) and confidence (c) from the input tuple. It then applies the formula to calculate the truth expectation value. The formula multiplies the confidence by the difference between the frequency and 0.5, and then adds 0.5 to the result.

This function is called by two other objects in the project: `truth_to_color` and `addImplicationEdge`. 

In the `truth_to_color` function, the `truth_expectation` function is used to calculate the truth expectation value and convert it to a color value. The resulting color value is used to represent the truth value visually.

In the `addImplicationEdge` function, the `truth_expectation` function is used to compare the truth expectation values of two truth values. If the truth expectation value of the input truth value is greater than the existing truth expectation value, the input truth value overrides the existing one. This comparison is used to determine the strength of implication edges in a graph.

**Note**: 
- The input truth value should be a tuple with two elements representing the frequency and confidence.
- The output of this function is a single value representing the truth expectation.

**Output Example**:
If the input truth value is (0.8, 0.6), the function will return 0.68.
## _function truth_to_color(truth)
**truth_to_color**: The function of truth_to_color is to convert a truth value into a color representation.

**parameters**:
- truth: A tuple representing the truth value, where the first element (f) represents the frequency and the second element (c) represents the confidence.

**Code Description**:
The `truth_to_color` function takes a truth value as input and converts it into a color representation. It first calls the `truth_expectation` function to calculate the truth expectation value based on the given truth value. The truth expectation value is then used to determine the color value.

The color value is calculated by multiplying the truth expectation value by 255 and converting it to an integer. This value represents the intensity of the red channel in the RGB color model. The green channel is set to 0, and the blue channel is calculated by subtracting the red channel value from 255. The resulting color value is formatted as a hexadecimal string in the format '#RRGGBB'.

This function is used in the OpenNARS-for-Applications project to visually represent the truth value in a graph.

**Note**: 
- The input truth value should be a tuple with two elements representing the frequency and confidence.
- The output of this function is a hexadecimal color string.

**Output Example**:
If the input truth value is (0.8, 0.6), the function will return the color '#cc00ff'.
## _function addImplicationEdge(a, b, operator, truth)
**addImplicationEdge**: The function of addImplicationEdge is to add or update an implication edge in a graph based on the given parameters.

**parameters**:
- a: The first concept in the implication edge.
- b: The second concept in the implication edge.
- operator: The operator associated with the implication edge.
- truth: The truth value associated with the implication edge. It is a list containing two elements: the frequency (f) and the confidence (c).

**Code Description**:
The `addImplicationEdge` function takes four parameters: `a`, `b`, `operator`, and `truth`. It first checks if the implication edge already exists in the graph by checking if the tuple `(a, b, UseOp)` is present in the `implicationEdges` dictionary. The variable `UseOp` is set to `True` if the `operator` parameter is not an empty string, indicating that an operator is associated with the implication edge.

If the implication edge already exists, the function retrieves the existing operator and truth value from the `implicationEdges` dictionary. It then compares the truth expectation value of the input `truth` value with the truth expectation value of the existing truth value using the `truth_expectation` function. If the input truth value has a higher truth expectation value, the `override` variable is set to `True`, indicating that the input truth value should override the existing one.

If the implication edge does not exist or if the input truth value should override the existing one, the `override` variable is set to `True`. In either case, the function updates the `implicationEdges` dictionary with the input parameters `(a, b, UseOp)` as the key and a tuple containing the `operator` and `truth` values as the value.

The `addImplicationEdge` function is called within the `concepts_to_graph.py` module of the OpenNARS-for-Applications project. It is responsible for managing the implication edges in the graph representation of concepts.

**Note**:
- The `operator` parameter can be an empty string if no operator is associated with the implication edge.
- The `truth` parameter should be a list containing two elements: the frequency (f) and the confidence (c).
- The `truth_expectation` function is used to compare the truth expectation values of two truth values.
- The `implicationEdges` dictionary is used to store the implication edges in the graph.
- The `override` variable is used to determine if the input truth value should override the existing one.
- The function modifies the `implicationEdges` dictionary to add or update the implication edge.
## _function truthstring(truth)
**truthstring**: The function of truthstring is to format a given truth value into a string representation.

**parameters**:
- truth: A tuple representing the truth value, where the first element is the belief value and the second element is the disbelief value.

**Code Description**:
The `truthstring` function takes a truth value as input and formats it into a string representation. It uses the `Format` variable, which is set to '{:0,.2f}', to format the belief and disbelief values of the truth value. The belief value is accessed using `truth[0]` and the disbelief value is accessed using `truth[1]`. The formatted string is then returned with the belief and disbelief values enclosed in curly braces and separated by a space.

The function is called within the `addImplicationEdges` function in the `concepts_to_graph.py` file. In this context, the `truthstring` function is used to format the belief and disbelief values of the truth values for different implication edges. The formatted strings are used to create labels for the edges in a graph representation.

**Note**:
- The `truth` parameter should be a tuple with two elements representing the belief and disbelief values.
- The function assumes that the `truth` parameter will always be a valid truth value.

**Output Example**:
If the `truth` parameter is (0.75, 0.25), the function will return the string "{0.75 0.25}".
## _function addImplicationEdges
**addImplicationEdges**: The function of addImplicationEdges is to add implication edges to a graph based on certain conditions and parameters.

**parameters**:
- NoProceduralLinks: A boolean value indicating whether to exclude procedural links.
- NoTemporalLinks: A boolean value indicating whether to exclude temporal links.
- Simplified: A boolean value indicating whether to simplify the graph representation.
- NoLinkLabels: A boolean value indicating whether to exclude link labels.

**Code Description**:
The `addImplicationEdges` function iterates over the `implicationEdges` list and adds edges to the graph based on certain conditions and parameters. 

The function first checks if `NoProceduralLinks` is True and `UseOp` is True, or if `NoTemporalLinks` is True and `UseOp` is False. If either of these conditions is met, the function skips the current iteration.

Next, the function checks if `Simplified` is True and `UseOp` is False, and if the edge `(a,b,True)` exists in `implicationEdges`. If both conditions are met, the function skips the current iteration.

If `UseOp` is True, the function retrieves the operator and truth value from `implicationEdges` for the edge `(a,b,True)`. It also retrieves the truth value for the edge `(a,b,False)` if it exists. The function then calls the `truth_to_color` function to convert the truth value into a color representation.

If `UseOp` is False, the function retrieves the truth value for the edge `(a,b,False)`. It also retrieves the operator and truth value for the edge `(a,b,True)` if it exists. The function then calls the `truth_to_color` function to convert the truth value into a color representation.

The function checks if both the truth values for `UseOp` and `not UseOp` have a confidence value greater than 0, and if `NoProceduralLinks` and `NoTemporalLinks` are both False. If these conditions are met, the variable `HaveBoth` is set to True.

The function constructs the label for the edge based on the conditions and values obtained. If `NoLinkLabels` is True, the label is set to an empty string.

Finally, the function adds the edge to the graph with the appropriate attributes, including the color, weight, label, and arrowsize.

The `addImplicationEdges` function is used in the OpenNARS-for-Applications project to add implication edges to a graph representation. It takes into account various conditions and parameters to determine the attributes of the edges.

**Note**:
- The `implicationEdges` variable is assumed to be a dictionary with tuples `(a,b,UseOp)` as keys and values representing the operator and truth values.
- The `truth_to_color` function is called to convert the truth values into color representations.
- The `truthstring` function is not directly called in this code, but it is mentioned in the comments as a reference for formatting truth values into strings.
## _function AddTermlink(source, target)
**AddTermlink**: The function of AddTermlink is to add a directed edge between two nodes in a graph.

**parameters**:
- source: The source node of the edge.
- target: The target node of the edge.

**Code Description**:
The AddTermlink function takes two parameters, source and target, representing the nodes between which the directed edge will be added. The function first checks if both the source and target nodes exist in the graph G and if they are not empty strings. If these conditions are met, the function adds an edge from the source node to the target node with the following properties:
- color: The color of the edge is set to 'green'.
- weight: The weight of the edge is set to 1.
- label: The label of the edge is set to an empty string.
- arrowsize: The size of the arrow representing the edge is set to 1.

Additionally, the function adds a corresponding edge from the target node to the source node with the same properties.

**Note**: 
- It is important to ensure that the source and target nodes exist in the graph G before calling the AddTermlink function.
- The source and target nodes should not be empty strings.
